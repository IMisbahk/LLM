england st petersburgh dec 11th 17— you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight do you understand this feeling this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour there—for with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes what may not be expected in a country of eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas’ library my education was neglected yet i was passionately fond of reading these volumes were my study day and night and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt as a child on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life these visions faded when i perused for the first time those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking i can even now remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise i commenced by inuring my body to hardship i accompanied the whalefishers on several expeditions to the north sea i voluntarily endured cold famine thirst and want of sleep i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage twice i actually hired myself as an undermate in a greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness so valuable did he consider my services and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose my life might have been passed in ease and luxury but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path oh that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm but my hopes fluctuate and my spirits are often depressed i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude i am required not only to raise the spirits of others but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs are failing this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges the motion is pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach the cold is not excessive if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which i have already adopted for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins i have no ambition to lose my life on the postroad between st petersburgh and archangel i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks and my intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whalefishing i do not intend to sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how can i answer this question if i succeed many many months perhaps years will pass before you and i may meet if i fail you will see me again soon or never farewell my dear excellent margaret heaven shower down blessings on you and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness your affectionate brother r walton letter 2 to mrs saville england archangel 28th march 17— how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have no friend margaret when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success there will be none to participate my joy if i am assailed by disappointment no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thoughts to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me whose eyes would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind whose tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties but it is a still greater evil to me that i am selfeducated for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas’ books of voyages at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country now i am twentyeight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want as the painters call it keeping and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind well these are useless complaints i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in these rugged bosoms my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his profession he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his wellknown integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prizemoney the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prizemoney to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations “what a noble fellow” you will exclaim he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his conduct the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know that i am wavering in my resolutions those are as fixed as fate and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation the winter has been dreadfully severe but the spring promises well and it is considered as a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected i shall do nothing rashly you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with which i am preparing to depart i am going to unexplored regions to “the land of mist and snow” but i shall kill no albatross therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “ancient mariner” you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret i have often attributed my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand i am practically industrious—painstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwined in all my projects which hurries me out of the common pathways of men even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore but to return to dearer considerations shall i meet you again after having traversed immense seas and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america i dare not expect such success yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits i love you very tenderly remember me with affection should you never hear from me again your affectionate brother robert walton letter 3 to mrs saville england july 7th 17— my dear sister i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe—and well advanced on my voyage this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel more fortunate than i who may not see my native land perhaps for many years i am however in good spirits my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing appear to dismay them we have already reached a very high latitude but it is the height of summer and although not so warm as in england the southern gales which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage adieu my dear margaret be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger i will be cool persevering and prudent but success shall crown my endeavours wherefore not thus far i have gone tracing a secure way over the pathless seas the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus but i must finish heaven bless my beloved sister rw letter 4 to mrs saville england august 5th 17— so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession last monday july 31st we were nearly surrounded by ice which closed in the ship on all sides scarcely leaving her the searoom in which she floated our situation was somewhat dangerous especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog we accordingly lay to hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather about two o’clock the mist cleared away and we beheld stretched out in every direction vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end some of my comrades groaned and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation we perceived a low carriage fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass on towards the north at the distance of half a mile a being which had the shape of a man but apparently of gigantic stature sat in the sledge and guided the dogs we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice this appearance excited our unqualified wonder we were as we believed many hundred miles from any land but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not in reality so distant as we had supposed shut in however by ice it was impossible to follow his track which we had observed with the greatest attention about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea and before night the ice broke and freed our ship we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice i profited of this time to rest for a few hours in the morning however as soon as it was light i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel apparently talking to someone in the sea it was in fact a sledge like that we had seen before which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice only one dog remained alive but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel he was not as the other traveller seemed to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european when i appeared on deck the master said “here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea” on perceiving me the stranger addressed me in english although with a foreign accent “before i come on board your vessel” said he “will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound” you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford i replied however that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board good god margaret if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety your surprise would have been boundless his limbs were nearly frozen and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering i never saw a man in so wretched a condition we attempted to carry him into the cabin but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding when he had in some measure recovered i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit i never saw a more interesting creature his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled but he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom and he replied “to seek one who fled from me” “and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion” “yes” “then i fancy we have seen him for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge with a man in it across the ice” this aroused the stranger’s attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon as he called him had pursued soon after when he was alone with me he said “i have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people but you are too considerate to make inquiries” “certainly it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine” “and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation you have benevolently restored me to life” soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time but of this i could not judge from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him although they have had very little communication with him for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion he must have been a noble creature in his better days being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable i said in one of my letters my dear margaret that i should find no friend on the wide ocean yet i have found a man who before his spirit had been broken by misery i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals should i have any fresh incidents to record august 13th 17— my affection for my guest increases every day he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief he is so gentle yet so wise his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others he has frequently conversed with me on mine which i have communicated to him without disguise he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise one man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race as i spoke a dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion he placed his hands before his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers a groan burst from his heaving breast i paused at length he spoke in broken accents “unhappy man do you share my madness have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught hear me let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips” such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion and quelling the dark tyranny of despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally he asked me the history of my earlier years the tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection i spoke of my desire of finding a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing “i agree with you” replied the stranger “we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures i once had a friend the most noble of human creatures and am entitled therefore to judge respecting friendship you have hope and the world before you and have no cause for despair but i—i have lost everything and cannot begin life anew” as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief that touched me to the heart but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin even broken in spirit as he is no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature the starry sky the sea and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth such a man has a double existence he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments yet when he has retired into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly ventures will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer you would not if you saw him you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world and you are therefore somewhat fastidious but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew i believe it to be an intuitive discernment a quick but neverfailing power of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soulsubduing music august 19th 17— yesterday the stranger said to me “you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the evervaried powers of nature nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed” you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power i expressed these feelings in my answer “i thank you” he replied “for your sympathy but it is useless my fate is nearly fulfilled i wait but for one event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling” continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him “but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined” he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this promise drew from me the warmest thanks i have resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties to record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related during the day if i should be engaged i will at least make notes this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his fulltoned voice swells in my ears his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus chapter 1 i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode overjoyed at this discovery he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house the interval was consequently spent in inaction his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity she procured plain work she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life several months passed in this manner her father grew worse her time was more entirely occupied in attending him her means of subsistence decreased and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation two years after this event caroline became his wife there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection there was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former years he had suffered from the latediscovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame from italy they visited germany and france i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles i remained for several years their only child much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me my mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections i was their plaything and their idol and something better—their child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of selfcontrol i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passion—remembering what she had suffered and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of halfclothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were darkeyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heavensent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse they were better off then they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italy—one among the schiavi ognor frementi who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country he became the victim of its weakness whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known his property was confiscated his child became an orphan and a beggar she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among darkleaved brambles when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills the apparition was soon explained with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her they were fond of the sweet orphan her presence had seemed a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures everyone loved elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully “i have a pretty present for my victor—tomorrow he shall have it” and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine—mine to protect love and cherish all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister since till death she was to be mine only chapter 2 we were brought up together there was not quite a year difference in our ages i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country we possessed a house in geneva and a campagne on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i was indifferent therefore to my schoolfellows in general but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva he was a boy of singular talent and fancy he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrinededicated lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy was ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness and clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self besides in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events which led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa i opened it with apathy the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicated my discovery to my father my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said “ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it is sad trash” if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical while those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses the most learned philosopher knew little more he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomise and give names but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva i was to a great degree selftaught with regard to my favourite studies my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with a child’s blindness added to a student’s thirst for knowledge under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention wealth was an inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death nor were these my only visions the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought and if my incantations were always unsuccessful i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens i remained while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house and so soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothing remained but a blasted stump when we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a wouldbe science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectual destiny was too potent and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction chapter 3 when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen as it were of my future misery elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her illness was severe and she was in the greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—elizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver on the third day my mother sickened her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself “my children” she said “my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union this expectation will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my younger children alas i regret that i am taken from you and happy and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thoughts befitting me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world” she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more to be heard these are the reflections of the first days but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished my mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized my departure for ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to death of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me and above all i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins never was she so enchanting as at this time when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget the day of my departure at length arrived clerval spent the last evening with us he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain his father was a narrowminded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education he said little but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce we sat late we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word “farewell” it was said and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose each fancying that the other was deceived but when at morning’s dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away they were all there—my father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—i was now alone in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances i loved my brothers elizabeth and clerval these were “old familiar faces” but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers such were my reflections as i commenced my journey but as i proceeded my spirits and hopes rose i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge i had often when at home thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings now my desires were complied with and it would indeed have been folly to repent i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors chance—or rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my father’s door—led me first to m krempe professor of natural philosophy he was an uncouth man but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy i replied carelessly and partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied the professor stared “have you” he said “really spent your time in studying such nonsense” i replied in the affirmative “every minute” continued m krempe with warmth “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names good god in what desert land have you lived where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient i little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew” so saying he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations and that m waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted i returned home not disappointed for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape m krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance the teacher therefore did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain perhaps i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists besides i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power such views although futile were grand but now the scene was changed the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode but as the ensuing week commenced i thought of the information which m krempe had given me concerning the lectures and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit i recollected what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i went into the lecturing room which m waldman entered shortly after this professor was very unlike his colleague he appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms after having made a few preparatory experiments he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which i shall never forget “the ancient teachers of this science” said he “promised impossibilities and performed nothing the modern masters promise very little they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hidingplaces they ascend into the heavens they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows” such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being chord after chord was sounded and soon my mind was filled with one thought one conception one purpose so much has been done exclaimed the soul of frankenstein—more far more will i achieve treading in the steps already marked i will pioneer a new way explore unknown powers and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation i closed not my eyes that night my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil i felt that order would thence arise but i had no power to produce it by degrees after the morning’s dawn sleep came i awoke and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m krempe had exhibited he said that “these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge they had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind” i listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists i expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure “i am happy” said m waldman “to have gained a disciple and if your application equals your ability i have no doubt of your success chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study but at the same time i have not neglected the other branches of science a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy including mathematics” he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism he also gave me the list of books which i had requested and i took my leave thus ended a day memorable to me it decided my future destiny chapter 4 from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the term became nearly my sole occupation i read with ardour those works so full of genius and discrimination which modern inquirers have written on these subjects i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i found even in m krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information combined it is true with a repulsive physiognomy and manners but not on that account the less valuable in m waldman i found a true friend his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory as i applied so closely it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students and my proficiency that of the masters professor krempe often asked me with a sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress two years passed in this manner during which i paid no visit to geneva but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you and there is nothing more to know but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study and i who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements i thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnelhouses my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret remember i am not recording the vision of a madman the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true some miracle might have produced it yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life nay more i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated and i beheld only the result what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express my friend that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted that cannot be listen patiently until the end of my story and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject i will not lead you on unguarded and ardent as i then was to your destruction and infallible misery learn from me if not by my precepts at least by my example how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles and veins still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler organization but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses my operations might be incessantly baffled and at last my work be imperfect yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved contrary to my first intention to make the being of a gigantic stature that is to say about eight feet in height and proportionably large after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success life and death appeared to me ideal bounds which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs pursuing these reflections i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time although i now found it impossible renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hidingplaces who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits i collected bones from charnelhouses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion the summer months passed while i was thus engaged heart and soul in one pursuit it was a most beautiful season never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom i had not seen for so long a time i knew my silence disquieted them and i well remembered the words of my father “i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection and we shall hear regularly from you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected” i knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination i wished as it were to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object which swallowed up every habit of my nature should be completed i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind if this rule were always observed if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections greece had not been enslaved cæsar would have spared his country america would have been discovered more gradually and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale and your looks remind me to proceed my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before winter spring and summer passed away during my labours but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was i engrossed in my occupation the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment every night i was oppressed by a slow fever and i became nervous to a most painful degree the fall of a leaf startled me and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become the energy of my purpose alone sustained me my labours would soon end and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete chapter 5 it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony i collected the instruments of life around me that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet it was already one in the morning the rain pattered dismally against the panes and my candle was nearly burnt out when by the glimmer of the halfextinguished light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open it breathed hard and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dunwhite sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body for this i had deprived myself of rest and health i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness but it was in vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the graveworms crawling in the folds of the flannel i started from my sleep with horror a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom i had created he held up the curtain of the bed and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch i had gazed on him while unfinished he was ugly then but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived i passed the night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness mingled with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me and the change was so rapid the overthrow so complete morning dismal and wet at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt its white steeple and clock which indicated the sixth hour the porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issued into the streets pacing them with quick steps as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky i continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear and i hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread coleridge’s “ancient mariner” continuing thus i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped here i paused i knew not why but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence it stopped just where i was standing and on the door being opened i perceived henry clerval who on seeing me instantly sprung out “my dear frankenstein” exclaimed he “how glad i am to see you how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting” nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval his presence brought back to my thoughts my father elizabeth and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection i grasped his hand and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune i felt suddenly and for the first time during many months calm and serene joy i welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordial manner and we walked towards my college clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt “you may easily believe” said he “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of bookkeeping and indeed i believe i left him incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield ‘i have ten thousand florins a year without greek i eat heartily without greek’ but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge” “it gives me the greatest delight to see you but tell me how you left my father brothers and elizabeth” “very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom by the by i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein” continued he stopping short and gazing full in my face “i did not before remark how very ill you appear so thin and pale you look as if you had been watching for several nights” “you have guessed right i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest as you see but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free” i trembled excessively i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night i walked with a quick pace and we soon arrived at my college i then reflected and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there alive and walking about i dreaded to behold this monster but i feared still more that henry should see him entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs i darted up towards my own room my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself i then paused and a cold shivering came over me i threw the door forcibly open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side but nothing appeared i stepped fearfully in the apartment was empty and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval we ascended into my room and the servant presently brought breakfast but i was unable to contain myself it was not joy only that possessed me i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place i jumped over the chairs clapped my hands and laughed aloud clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival but when he observed me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him “my dear victor” cried he “what for god’s sake is the matter do not laugh in that manner how ill you are what is the cause of all this” “do not ask me” cried i putting my hands before my eyes for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room “he can tell oh save me save me” i imagined that the monster seized me i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit poor clerval what must have been his feelings a meeting which he anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness but i was not the witness of his grief for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long long time this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months during all that time henry was my only nurse i afterwards learned that knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself and firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them but i was in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes and i raved incessantly concerning him doubtless my words surprised henry he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend i recovered i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window it was a divine spring and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom my gloom disappeared and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion “dearest clerval” exclaimed i “how kind how very good you are to me this whole winter instead of being spent in study as you promised yourself has been consumed in my sick room how shall i ever repay you i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion but you will forgive me” “you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well as fast as you can and since you appear in such good spirits i may speak to you on one subject may i not” i trembled one subject what could it be could he allude to an object on whom i dared not even think “compose yourself” said clerval who observed my change of colour “i will not mention it if it agitates you but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence” “is that all my dear henry how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love” “if this is your present temper my friend you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you it is from your cousin i believe” chapter 6 clerval then put the following letter into my hands it was from my own elizabeth “my dearest cousin “you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account you are forbidden to write—to hold a pen yet one word from you dear victor is necessary to calm our apprehensions for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin yet that is over now clerval writes that indeed you are getting better i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting “get well—and return to us you will find a happy cheerful home and friends who love you dearly your father’s health is vigorous and he asks but to see you but to be assured that you are well and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service but we cannot part with him at least until his elder brother returns to us my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never had your powers of application he looks upon study as an odious fetter his time is spent in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected “little alteration except the growth of our dear children has taken place since you left us the blue lake and snowclad mountains—they never change and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy kind faces around me since you left us but one change has taken place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few words madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m moritz treated her very ill my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england justine thus received in our family learned the duties of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being “justine you may remember was a great favourite of yours and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica—she looked so frankhearted and happy my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended this benefit was fully repaid justine was the most grateful little creature in the world i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her “when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine was very ill but other trials were reserved for her “one by one her brothers and sister died and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless the conscience of the woman was troubled she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she was a roman catholic and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine has just returned to us and i assure you i love her tenderly she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt “i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health he has already had one or two little wives but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age “now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon married m duvillard the rich banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody “i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude write dearest victor—one line—one word will be a blessing to us ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness his affection and his many letters we are sincerely grateful adieu my cousin take care of yourself and i entreat you write “elizabeth lavenza “geneva march 18th 17—” “dear dear elizabeth” i exclaimed when i had read her letter “i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel” i wrote and this exertion greatly fatigued me but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors m waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences he soon perceived that i disliked the subject but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out what could i do he meant to please and he tormented me i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance and the conversation took a more general turn i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply m krempe was not equally docile and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m waldman “d—n the fellow” cried he “why m clerval i assure you he has outstript us all ay stare if you please but it is nevertheless true a youngster who but a few years ago believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel has now set himself at the head of the university and if he is not soon pulled down we shall all be out of countenance—ay ay” continued he observing my face expressive of suffering “m frankenstein is modest an excellent quality in a young man young men should be diffident of themselves you know m clerval i was myself when young but that wears out in a very short time” m krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellowpupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome summer passed away in these occupations and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn but being delayed by several accidents winter and snow arrived the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring i felt this delay very bitterly for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants the winter however was spent cheerfully and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness the month of may had already commenced and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited i acceded with pleasure to this proposition i was fond of exercise and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country we passed a fortnight in these perambulations my health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed the natural incidents of our progress and the conversation of my friend study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellowcreatures and rendered me unsocial but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses i became the same happy creature who a few years ago loved and beloved by all had no sorrow or care when happy inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy the present season was indeed divine the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off with an invincible burden henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings he exerted himself to amuse me while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing his conversation was full of imagination and very often in imitation of the persian and arabic writers he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion at other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon the peasants were dancing and every one we met appeared gay and happy my own spirits were high and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity chapter 7 on my return i found the following letter from my father— “my dear victor “you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you but that would be a cruel kindness and i dare not do it what would be your surprise my son when you expected a happy and glad welcome to behold on the contrary tears and wretchedness and how victor can i relate our misfortune absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son i wish to prepare you for the woeful news but i know it is impossible even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings “william is dead—that sweet child whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart who was so gentle yet so gay victor he is murdered “i will not attempt to console you but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction “last thursday may 7th i my niece and your two brothers went to walk in plainpalais the evening was warm and serene and we prolonged our walk farther than usual it was already dusk before we thought of returning and then we discovered that william and ernest who had gone on before were not to be found we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return presently ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother he said that he had been playing with him that william had run away to hide himself and that he vainly sought for him and afterwards waited for a long time but that he did not return “this account rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him until night fell when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house he was not there we returned again with torches for i could not rest when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless the print of the murder’s finger was on his neck “he was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth she was very earnest to see the corpse at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed ‘o god i have murdered my darling child’ “she fainted and was restored with extreme difficulty when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh she told me that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother this picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed we have no trace of him at present although our exertions to discover him are unremitted but they will not restore my beloved william “come dearest victor you alone can console elizabeth she weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death her words pierce my heart we are all unhappy but will not that be an additional motive for you my son to return and be our comforter your dear mother alas victor i now say thank god she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling “come victor not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wounds of our minds enter the house of mourning my friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you and not with hatred for your enemies “your affectionate and afflicted father “alphonse frankenstein “geneva may 12th 17—” clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving new from my friends i threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands “my dear frankenstein” exclaimed henry when he perceived me weep with bitterness “are you always to be unhappy my dear friend what has happened” i motioned him to take up the letter while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval as he read the account of my misfortune “i can offer you no consolation my friend” said he “your disaster is irreparable what do you intend to do” “to go instantly to geneva come with me henry to order the horses” during our walk clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation he could only express his heartfelt sympathy “poor william” said he “dear lovely child he now sleeps with his angel mother who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so miserably to feel the murderer’s grasp how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence poor little fellow one only consolation have we his friends mourn and weep but he is at rest the pang is over his sufferings are at an end for ever a sod covers his gentle form and he knows no pain he can no longer be a subject for pity we must reserve that for his miserable survivors” clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude but now as soon as the horses arrived i hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend my journey was very melancholy at first i wished to hurry on for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends but when i drew near my native town i slackened my progress i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind i passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which i had not seen for nearly six years how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which although they were done more tranquilly might not be the less decisive fear overcame me i dared no advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble although i was unable to define them i remained two days at lausanne in this painful state of mind i contemplated the lake the waters were placid all around was calm and the snowy mountains “the palaces of nature” were not changed by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me and i continued my journey towards geneva the road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as i approached my native town i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc i wept like a child “dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer your summits are clear the sky and lake are blue and placid is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness” i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances but they were days of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure my country my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake yet as i drew nearer home grief and fear again overcame me night also closed around and when i could hardly see the dark mountains i felt still more gloomily the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings alas i prophesied truly and failed only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva the gates of the town were already shut and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the city the sky was serene and as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered as i could not pass through the town i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures the storm appeared to approach rapidly and on landing i ascended a low hill that i might observe its progress it advanced the heavens were clouded and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly increased i quitted my seat and walked on although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head it was echoed from salêve the juras and the alps of savoy vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake making it appear like a vast sheet of fire then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash the storm as is often the case in switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of copêt another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the môle a peaked mountain to the east of the lake while i watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wandered on with a hasty step this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits i clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud “william dear angel this is thy funeral this thy dirge” as i said these words i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me i stood fixed gazing intently i could not be mistaken a flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly informed me that it was the wretch the filthy dæmon to whom i had given life what did he there could he be i shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother no sooner did that idea cross my imagination than i became convinced of its truth my teeth chattered and i was forced to lean against a tree for support the figure passed me quickly and i lost it in the gloom nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child he was the murderer i could not doubt it the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact i thought of pursuing the devil but it would have been in vain for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont salêve a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south he soon reached the summit and disappeared i remained motionless the thunder ceased but the rain still continued and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget the whole train of my progress toward the creation the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside its departure two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life and was this his first crime alas i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery had he not murdered my brother no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night which i spent cold and wet in the open air but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror such as the deed which he had now done nearly in the light of my own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me day dawned and i directed my steps towards the town the gates were open and i hastened to my father’s house my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell a being whom i myself had formed and endued with life had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity besides the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it and then of what use would be pursuit who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont salêve these reflections determined me and i resolved to remain silent it was about five in the morning when i entered my father’s house i told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising six years had elapsed passed in a dream but for one indelible trace and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt beloved and venerable parent he still remained to me i gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantelpiece it was an historical subject painted at my father’s desire and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead father her garb was rustic and her cheek pale but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity below this picture was a miniature of william and my tears flowed when i looked upon it while i was thus engaged ernest entered he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me “welcome my dearest victor” said he “ah i wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting selfaccusations—poor william he was our darling and our pride” tears unrestrained fell from my brother’s eyes a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame before i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster i tried to calm ernest i enquired more minutely concerning my father and here i named my cousin “she most of all” said ernest “requires consolation she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother and that made her very wretched but since the murderer has been discovered—” “the murderer discovered good god how can that be who could attempt to pursue him it is impossible one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountainstream with a straw i saw him too he was free last night” “i do not know what you mean” replied my brother in accents of wonder “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery no one would believe it at first and even now elizabeth will not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence indeed who would credit that justine moritz who was so amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appalling a crime” “justine moritz poor poor girl is she the accused but it is wrongfully every one knows that no one believes it surely ernest” “no one did at first but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt but she will be tried today and you will then hear all” he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer the servant instantly showed it to one of the others who without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate and upon their deposition justine was apprehended on being charged with the fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and i replied earnestly “you are all mistaken i know the murderer justine poor good justine is innocent” at that instant my father entered i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster had not ernest exclaimed “good god papa victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william” “we do also unfortunately” replied my father “for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly” “my dear father you are mistaken justine is innocent” “if she is god forbid that she should suffer as guilty she is to be tried today and i hope i sincerely hope that she will be acquitted” this speech calmed me i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder i had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her my tale was not one to announce publicly its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar did any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world we were soon joined by elizabeth time had altered her since i last beheld her it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years there was the same candour the same vivacity but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect she welcomed me with the greatest affection “your arrival my dear cousin” said she “fills me with hope you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine alas who is safe if she be convicted of crime i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own our misfortune is doubly hard to us we have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love is to be torn away by even a worse fate if she is condemned i never shall know joy more but she will not i am sure she will not and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william” “she is innocent my elizabeth” said i “and that shall be proved fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal” “how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt and that made me wretched for i knew that it was impossible and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing” she wept “dearest niece” said my father “dry your tears if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our laws and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality” chapter 8 we passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock when the trial was to commence my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses i accompanied them to the court during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me the appearance of justine was calm she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed she was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness the trial began and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a marketwoman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer she returned to the house about eight o’clock and when one inquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him when shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket and when elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court justine was called on for her defence as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice “god knows” she said “how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious” she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chêne a village situated at about a league from geneva on her return at about nine o’clock she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of geneva were shut and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known most of the night she spent here watching towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes some steps disturbed her and she awoke it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned by the marketwoman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concerning the picture she could give no account “i know” continued the unhappy victim “how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket but here also i am checked i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly did the murderer place it there i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing or if i had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon “i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence” several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court “i am” said she “the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character i am well acquainted with the accused i have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nearly two years during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncle’s house where she was beloved by all the family she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she had no temptation for such an action as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her” a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth’s simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial i believed in her innocence i knew it could the dæmon who had i did not for a minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy i could not sustain the horror of my situation and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out of the court in agony the tortures of the accused did not equal mine she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness in the morning i went to the court my lips and throat were parched i dared not ask the fatal question but i was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit the ballots had been thrown they were all black and justine was condemned i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt i had before experienced sensations of horror and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey an idea of the heartsickening despair that i then endured the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt “that evidence” he observed “was hardly required in so glaring a case but i am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive” this was strange and unexpected intelligence what could it mean had my eyes deceived me and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions i hastened to return home and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result “my cousin” replied i “it is decided as you may have expected all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape but she has confessed” this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness upon justine’s innocence “alas” said she “how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i loved and esteemed as my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she has committed a murder” soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide “yes” said elizabeth “i will go although she is guilty and you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone” the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end her hands were manacled and her head rested on her knees she rose on seeing us enter and when we were left alone with her she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth weeping bitterly my cousin wept also “oh justine” said she “why did you rob me of my last consolation i relied on your innocence and although i was then very wretched i was not so miserable as i am now” “and do you also believe that i am so very very wicked do you also join with my enemies to crush me to condemn me as a murderer” her voice was suffocated with sobs “rise my poor girl” said elizabeth “why do you kneel if you are innocent i am not one of your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession” “i did confess but i confessed a lie i confessed that i might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins the god of heaven forgive me ever since i was condemned my confessor has besieged me he threatened and menaced until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate dear lady i had none to support me all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition what could i do in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie and now only am i truly miserable” she paused weeping and then continued “i thought with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy and that consoles me going as i am to suffer ignominy and death” “oh justine forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you why did you confess but do not mourn dear girl do not fear i will proclaim i will prove your innocence i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune” justine shook her head mournfully “i do not fear to die” she said “that pang is past god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst i leave a sad and bitter world and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven” during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me despair who dared talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul justine started when she saw who it was she approached me and said “dear sir you are very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe that i am guilty” i could not answer “no justine” said elizabeth “he is more convinced of your innocence than i was for even when he heard that you had confessed he did not credit it” “i truly thank him in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you dear lady and your cousin” thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself she indeed gained the resignation she desired but i the true murderer felt the neverdying worm alive in my bosom which allowed of no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away “i wish” cried she “that i were to die with you i cannot live in this world of misery” justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of halfsuppressed emotion “farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so” and on the morrow justine died elizabeth’s heartrending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men my purposed avowal died away on my lips thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim she perished on the scaffold as a murderess from the tortures of my own heart i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth this also was my doing and my father’s woe and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thriceaccursed hands ye weep unhappy ones but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein your son your kinsman your early muchloved friend he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep to shed countless tears happy beyond his hopes if thus inexorable fate be satisfied and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments thus spoke my prophetic soul as torn by remorse horror and despair i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts chapter 9 nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear justine died she rested and i was alive the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove sleep fled from my eyes i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more i persuaded myself was yet behind yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings now all was blasted instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained i shunned the face of man all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me solitude was my only consolation—deep dark deathlike solitude my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me “do you think victor” said he “that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i loved your brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief it is also a duty owed to yourself for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment or even the discharge of daily usefulness without which no man is fit for society” this advice although good was totally inapplicable to my case i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness and terror its alarm with my other sensations now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view about this time we retired to our house at belrive this change was particularly agreeable to me the shutting of the gates regularly at ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me i was now free often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore—often i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviving brother should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness but that could not be remorse extinguished every hope i had been the author of unalterable evils and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes could i when there have precipitated him to their base i wished to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine our house was the house of mourning my father’s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles “when i reflect my dear cousin” said she “on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood yet i am certainly unjust everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch” i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said “my dearest friend you must calm yourself these events have affected me god knows how deeply but i am not so wretched as you are there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble dear victor banish these dark passions remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you have we lost the power of rendering you happy ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace” and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it and to die was but a type of me sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my intolerable sensations it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys sought in the magnificence the eternity of such scenes to forget myself and my ephemeral because human sorrows my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix i had visited it frequently during my boyhood six years had passed since then i was a wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes i performed the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hired a mule as the more surefooted and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads the weather was fine it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotence—and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific guise still as i ascended higher the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains the impetuous arve and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all as belonging to another earth the habitations of another race of beings i passed the bridge of pélissier where the ravine which the river forms opened before me and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it soon after i entered the valley of chamounix this valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox through which i had just passed the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields immense glaciers approached the road i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles and its tremendous dôme overlooked the valley a tingling longlost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey some turn in the road some new object suddenly perceived and recognised reminded me of days gone by and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood the very winds whispered in soothing accents and maternal nature bade me weep no more then again the kindly influence ceased to act—i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection then i spurred on my animal striving so to forget the world my fears and more than all myself—or in a more desperate fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair at length i arrived at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion chapter 10 i spent the following day roaming through the valley i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me the icy wall of the glacier overhung me a few shattered pines were scattered around and the solemn silence of this glorious presencechamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month i retired to rest at night my slumbers as it were waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day they congregated round me the unstained snowy mountaintop the glittering pinnacle the pine woods and ragged bare ravine the eagle soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace where had they fled when the next morning i awoke all of soulinspiriting fled with sleep and dark melancholy clouded every thought the rain was pouring in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats what were rain and storm to me my mule was brought to the door and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and evermoving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life i determined to go without a guide for i was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene the ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain it is a scene terrifically desolate in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees the path as you ascend higher is intersected by ravines of snow down which stones continually roll from above one of them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as even speaking in a loud voice produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker the pines are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene i looked on the valley beneath vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute it only renders them more necessary beings if our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us we rest a dream has power to poison sleep we rise one wand’ring thought pollutes the day we feel conceive or reason laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our cares away it is the same for be it joy or sorrow the path of its departure still is free man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow nought may endure but mutability it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds my heart which was before sorrowful now swelled with something like joy i exclaimed “wandering spirits if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life” as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed he bounded over the crevices in the ice among which i had walked with caution his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man i was troubled a mist came over my eyes and i felt a faintness seize me but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains i perceived as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred that it was the wretch whom i had created i trembled with rage and horror resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat he approached his countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignity while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes but i scarcely observed this rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt “devil” i exclaimed “do you dare approach me and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust and oh that i could with the extinction of your miserable existence restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered” “i expected this reception” said the dæmon “all men hate the wretched how then must i be hated who am miserable beyond all living things yet you my creator detest and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us you purpose to kill me how dare you sport thus with life do your duty towards me and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind if you will comply with my conditions i will leave them and you at peace but if you refuse i will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends” “abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes wretched devil you reproach me with your creation come on then that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed” my rage was without bounds i sprang on him impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another he easily eluded me and said “be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head have i not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it remember thou hast made me more powerful than thyself my height is superior to thine my joints more supple but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee i am thy creature and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part the which thou owest me oh frankenstein be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone to whom thy justice and even thy clemency and affection is most due remember that i am thy creature i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed everywhere i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded i was benevolent and good misery made me a fiend make me happy and i shall again be virtuous” “begone i will not hear you there can be no community between you and me we are enemies begone or let us try our strength in a fight in which one must fall” “how can i move thee will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature who implores thy goodness and compassion believe me frankenstein i was benevolent my soul glowed with love and humanity but am i not alone miserably alone you my creator abhor me what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures who owe me nothing they spurn and hate me the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge i have wandered here many days the caves of ice which i only do not fear are a dwelling to me and the only one which man does not grudge these bleak skies i hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction shall i not then hate them who abhor me i will keep no terms with my enemies i am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness yet it is in your power to recompense me and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve but hear me the guilty are allowed by human laws bloody as they are to speak in their own defence before they are condemned listen to me frankenstein you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature oh praise the eternal justice of man yet i ask you not to spare me listen to me and then if you can and if you will destroy the work of your hands” “why do you call to my remembrance” i rejoined “circumstances of which i shudder to reflect that i have been the miserable origin and author cursed be the day abhorred devil in which you first saw light cursed although i curse myself be the hands that formed you you have made me wretched beyond expression you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not begone relieve me from the sight of your detested form” “thus i relieve thee my creator” he said and placed his hated hands before my eyes which i flung from me with violence “thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion by the virtues that i once possessed i demand this from you hear my tale it is long and strange and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations come to the hut upon the mountain the sun is yet high in the heavens before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin” as he said this he led the way across the ice i followed my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion for the first time also i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness these motives urged me to comply with his demand we crossed the ice therefore and ascended the opposite rock the air was cold and the rain again began to descend we entered the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits but i consented to listen and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted he thus began his tale chapter 11 “it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep “it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate before i had quitted your apartment on a sensation of cold i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night i was a poor helpless miserable wretch i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept “soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak with which i covered myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure “several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes i began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again “the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing “one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep “it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire i uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved “food however became scarce and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground “it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetrate the ground was dry and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep “it was noon when i awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground i determined to recommence my travels and depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet i found i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village how miraculous did this appear the huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns the vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it my place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain “here then i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out all the light i enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me “having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm “being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the raindropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard “on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions “soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire she afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots after he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together “the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures one was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency the old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields “night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters “the family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as i conjectured to rest” chapter 12 “i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions “the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal “this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles “they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy they possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes and every luxury they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one another’s company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply did they really express pain i was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic “a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves “this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood “i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days “i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden “by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose their pronunciation was quick and the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves the youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had only one which was father the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy “i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathised in their joys i saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends the old man i could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man “i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers in the midst of poverty and want felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milkhouse drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha “this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour for i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted “i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace beauty and delicate complexions but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity “as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth from this time felix was more employed and the heartmoving indications of impending famine disappeared their food as i afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced “the old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters this frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been “my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was starlight i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage when i returned as often as it was necessary i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix i afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful but i did not then understand the signification of these terms “my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flitted before me i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me i imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words i should first win their favour and afterwards their love “these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease it was as the ass and the lapdog yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration “the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation the birds sang in more cheerful notes and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before was bleak damp and unwholesome my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature the past was blotted from my memory the present was tranquil and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy” chapter 13 “i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am “spring advanced rapidly the weather became fine and the skies cloudless it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty “it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar and the children listened to him—that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door “it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a countryman as a guide the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided her eyes were dark but gentle although animated her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink “felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage some conversation took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately “i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian agatha the evergentle agatha kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others “as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said ‘good night sweet safie’ he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible “the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods “when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music “the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors “in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered “my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken “while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight “the book from which felix instructed safie was volney’s ruins of empires i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it given very minute explanations he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants “these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing “every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood “the words induced me to turn towards myself i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned “i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat “of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was death—a state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me miserable unhappy wretch “other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds “but where were my friends and relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans “i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved in an innocent halfpainful selfdeceit to call them” chapter 14 “some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was “the name of the old man was de lacey he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford “the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him he was tried and condemned to death the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant all paris was indignant and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation “felix had accidentally been present at the trial his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard “the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness “during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate “i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha before i depart i will give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you “safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements illsuited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her “the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris “felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions “safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks and safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country “the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris “the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding “he did not succeed they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country “they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheardof oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance “such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul “when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate “a few days after the turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours he intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn “when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany “she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world she fell however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover” chapter 15 “such was the history of my beloved cottagers it impressed me deeply i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind “as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year “one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage they consisted of paradise lost a volume of plutarch’s lives and the sorrows of werter the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations “i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection in the sorrows of werter besides the interest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a neverending source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but it sank deep the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it “as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none ‘the path of my departure was free’ and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them “the volume of plutarch’s lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter i learned from werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations “but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me “another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible i sickened as i read ‘hateful day when i received life’ i exclaimed in agony ‘accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred’ “these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every day’s experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity “several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade “i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone i remembered adam’s supplication to his creator but where was mine he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him “autumn passed thus i saw with surprise and grief the leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer they loved and sympathised with one another and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food or rest i required kindness and sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it “the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors “one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage when his children had departed he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection “my heart beat quick this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair all was silent in and around the cottage it was an excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage “i knocked ‘who is there’ said the old man ‘come in’ “i entered ‘pardon this intrusion’ said i ‘i am a traveller in want of a little rest you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire’ “‘enter’ said de lacey ‘and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you’ “‘do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food it is warmth and rest only that i need’ “i sat down and a silence ensued i knew that every minute was precious to me yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview when the old man addressed me ‘by your language stranger i suppose you are my countryman are you french’ “‘no but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only i am now going to claim the protection of some friends whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hopes’ “‘are they germans’ “‘no they are french but let us change the subject i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me i am full of fears for if i fail there i am an outcast in the world for ever’ “‘do not despair to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious selfinterest are full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hopes and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair’ “‘they are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me i have good dispositions my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster’ “‘that is indeed unfortunate but if you are really blameless cannot you undeceive them’ “‘i am about to undertake that task and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors i tenderly love these friends i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome’ “‘where do these friends reside’ “‘near this spot’ “the old man paused and then continued ‘if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature’ “‘excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures’ “‘heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue i also am unfortunate i and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes’ “‘how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting’ “‘may i know the names and residence of those friends’ “i paused this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried ‘now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial’ “‘great god’ exclaimed the old man ‘who are you’ “at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick i could have torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel” chapter 16 “cursed cursed creator why did i live why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession of me my feelings were those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery “when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save i were at rest or in enjoyment i like the archfiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathised with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin “but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemies no from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery “the sun rose i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation “the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party “these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his father’s feet i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hidingplace and went in search of food “when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense “presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances “‘do you consider’ said his companion to him ‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination’ “‘it is utterly useless’ replied felix ‘we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related my wife and my sister will never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place’ “felix trembled violently as he said this he and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes and then departed i never saw any of the family of de lacey more “i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friends of the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations “as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues “as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods “and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed “but how was i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being but i did not despair from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form “my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless rain and snow poured around me mighty rivers were frozen the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh earth how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country but i often wandered wide from my path the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings “i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me “i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream i rushed from my hidingplace and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood “this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the agony of my wound overcame me my pulses paused and i fainted “for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through at any rate i had no means of extracting it my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured “after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure “but my toils now drew near a close and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva “it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hidingplace among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura “at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth “urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said ‘child what is the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me’ “he struggled violently ‘let me go’ he cried ‘monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces you are an ogre let me go or i will tell my papa’ “‘boy you will never see your father again you must come with me’ “‘hideous monster let me go my papa is a syndic—he is m frankenstein—he will punish you you dare not keep me’ “‘frankenstein you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge you shall be my first victim’ “the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart i grasped his throat to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my feet “i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed ‘i too can create desolation my enemy is not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him’ “as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast i took it it was a portrait of a most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered that i was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright “can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them “while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hidingplace i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty a woman was sleeping on some straw she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought is one of those whose joyimparting smiles are bestowed on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered ‘awake fairest thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes my beloved awake’ “the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror ran through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me the thought was madness it stirred the fiend within me—not i but she shall suffer the murder i have committed because i am for ever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime had its source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress she moved again and i fled “for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition i am alone and miserable man will not associate with me but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects this being you must create” chapter 17 the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition he continued “you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede” the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me “i do refuse it” i replied “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answered you you may torture me but i will never consent” “you are in the wrong” replied the fiend “and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned and hated by all mankind you my creator would tear me to pieces and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me you would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those icerifts and destroy my frame the work of your own hands shall i respect man when he condemns me let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injuries if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my archenemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred have a care i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth” a fiendish rage animated him as he said this his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold but presently he calmed himself and proceeded— “i intended to reason this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold for that one creature’s sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself the gratification is small but it is all that i can receive and it shall content me it is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be more attached to one another our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing do not deny me my request” i was moved i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continued “if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again i will go to the vast wilds of south america my food is not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leaves the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire” “you propose” replied i “to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their detestation your evil passions will be renewed and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction this may not be cease to argue the point for i cannot consent” “how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker” his words had a strange effect upon me i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred i tried to stifle these sensations i thought that as i could not sympathise with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow “you swear” i said “to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge” “how is this i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer if i have no ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded” i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations a creature who could exist in the icecaves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request turning to him therefore i said “i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever and every other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile” “i swear” he cried “by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and commence your labours i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear” saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced night was far advanced when i came to the halfway restingplace and seated myself beside the fountain the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed “oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me become as nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness” these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak i felt as if i were placed under a ban—as if i had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i loved them to adoration and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life chapter 18 day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me “i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all” i trembled violently at his exordium and my father continued— “i confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy you studied together and appeared in dispositions and tastes entirely suited to one another but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife nay you may have met with another whom you may love and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel” “my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union” “the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage we have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities you are younger yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity” i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror i was aware also that i should often lose all selfcommand all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfilled the monster would depart for ever or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever these feelings dictated my answer to my father i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself the duration of my absence was left to my own choice a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return my father’s age rendered him extremely averse to delay for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief it had been her care which provided me a companion in clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s sedulous attention she longed to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i waited two days for clerval he came alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky “this is what it is to live” he cried “now i enjoy existence but you my dear frankenstein wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful” in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrived at mainz the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he had been transported to fairyland and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man “i have seen” he said “the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be on the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country” clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving he was a being formed in the “very poetry of nature” his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldlyminded teach us to look for only in the imagination but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he loved with ardour— ——the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrow’d from the eye wordsworth’s “tintern abbey” and where does he now exist is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creator—has this mind perished does it now only exist in my memory no it is not thus your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates i will proceed with my tale beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland and we resolved to post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but we arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to england it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first saw the white cliffs of britain the banks of the thames presented a new scene they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwich—places which i had heard of even in my country at length we saw the numerous steeples of london st paul’s towering above all and the tower famed in english history chapter 19 london was our present point of rest we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound company was irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he was for ever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation and i although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwellingplaces we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of july i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest this was a new scene to us mountaineers the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us from thence we proceeded to oxford as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before it was here that charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we delighted to trace its footsteps if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the colleges are ancient and picturesque the streets are almost magnificent and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future i was formed for peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by ennui the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits but i am a blasted tree the bolt has entered my soul and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself we passed a considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and selfsacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors “i could pass my life here” said he to me “and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine” but he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments his feelings are for ever on the stretch and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on for my own part i was not sorry i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace i waited for my letters with feverish impatience if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being clerval did not like it so well as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romantic castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthur’s seat st bernard’s well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st andrew’s and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone “do you” said i “enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you leave me to peace and solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper” henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate he entreated me to write often “i had rather be with you” he said “in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence” having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured from the mainland which was about five miles distant on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty as it was i lived ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet it was a monotonous yet everchanging scene i thought of switzerland it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work it was indeed a filthy process in which i was engaged during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless and nervous every moment i feared to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom chapter 20 i sat one evening in my laboratory the sun had set and the moon was just rising from the sea i had not sufficient light for my employment and i remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but she had not and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation they might even hate each other the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form she also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror had i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me yes he had followed me in my travels he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours and then with trembling steps i sought my own apartment i was alone none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly i trembled from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine but i was overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage the door opened and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared shutting the door he approached me and said in a smothered voice “you have destroyed the work which you began what is it that you intend do you dare to break your promise i have endured toil and misery i left switzerland with you i crept along the shores of the rhine among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do you dare destroy my hopes” “begone i do break my promise never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and wickedness” “slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension remember that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you you are my creator but i am your master obey” “the hour of my irresolution is past and the period of your power is arrived your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage” the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger “shall each man” cried he “find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other passions but revenge remains—revenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom man you shall repent of the injuries you inflict” “devil cease and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words leave me i am inexorable” “it is well i go but remember i shall be with you on your weddingnight” i started forward and exclaimed “villain before you sign my deathwarrant be sure that you are yourself safe” i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves all was again silent but his words rang in my ears i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife but i had suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland i shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge and then i thought again of his words—“i will be with you on your weddingnight” that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the first i had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean my feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair i left the house the horrid scene of the last night’s contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me i desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery if i returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom i had myself created i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a deathknell they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishingboat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shuddered to reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpose i must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory the remains of the halffinished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants and i accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion between two and three in the morning the moon rose and i then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore the scene was perfectly solitary a few boats were returning towards land but i sailed away from them i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures at one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea i listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot the sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably the wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror i had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me i had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings i looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others i looked upon the sea it was to be my grave “fiend” i exclaimed “your task is already fulfilled” i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clerval—all left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever i shudder to reflect on it some hours passed thus but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers but these gave place to a heavy swell i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south almost spent as i was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land it had a wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory as i was in a state of extreme debility i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money with me as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language “my good friends” said i “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am” “you will know that soon enough” replied a man with a hoarse voice “maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consulted as to your quarters i promise you” i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions “why do you answer me so roughly” i replied “surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably” “i do not know” said the man “what the custom of the english may be but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains” while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me i inquired the way to the inn but no one replied i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an illlooking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said “come sir you must follow me to mr kirwin’s to give an account of yourself” “who is mr kirwin why am i to give an account of myself is not this a free country” “ay sir free enough for honest folks mr kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night” this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death i must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which i am about to relate in proper detail to my recollection chapter 21 i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten o’clock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner the son confirmed his father’s account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where i had deposited the corpse mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed “have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor—” the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured and i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions a fever succeeded to this i lay for two months on the point of death my ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror fortunately as i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses why did i not die more miserable than man ever was before why did i not sink into forgetfulness and rest death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me in english and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings “are you better now sir” said she i replied in the same language with a feeble voice “i believe i am but if it be all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror” “for that matter” replied the old woman “if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however that’s none of my business i am sent to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it were well if everybody did the same” i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality as the images that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish a darkness pressed around me no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand supported me the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee these were my first reflections but i soon learned that mr kirwin had shown me extreme kindness he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals one day while i was gradually recovering i was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness at one time i considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr kirwin entered his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in french “i fear that this place is very shocking to you can i do anything to make you more comfortable” “i thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving” “i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge” “that is my least concern i am by a course of strange events become the most miserable of mortals persecuted and tortured as i am and have been can death be any evil to me” “nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path” as mr kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for mr kirwin hastened to say “immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness i found several letters and among others one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father i instantly wrote to geneva nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter but you are ill even now you tremble you are unfit for agitation of any kind” “this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event tell me what new scene of death has been acted and whose murder i am now to lament” “your family is perfectly well” said mr kirwin with gentleness “and someone a friend is come to visit you” i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony “oh take him away i cannot see him for god’s sake do not let him enter” mr kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance he could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone “i should have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance” “my father” cried i while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure “is my father indeed come how kind how very kind but where is he why does he not hasten to me” my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it nothing at this moment could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father i stretched out my hand to him and cried “are you then safe—and elizabeth—and ernest” my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness “what a place is this that you inhabit my son” said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room “you travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you and poor clerval—” the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state i shed tears “alas yes my father” replied i “some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me and i must live to fulfil it or surely i should have died on the coffin of henry” we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the image of clerval was for ever before me ghastly and murdered more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny which is now drawing to a close soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins the season of the assizes approached i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held mr kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful the cup of life was poisoned for ever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but these words only drew deep groans from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring maladie du pays to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being my strength was gone i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father thought it best to yield we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havredegrace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores it was midnight i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole life my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived i was unable to pursue the train of thought a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare i felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groans and cries rang in my ears my father who was watching over me perceiving my restlessness awoke me the dashing waves were around the cloudy sky above the fiend was not here a sense of security a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible chapter 22 the voyage came to an end we landed and proceeded to paris i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey my father’s care and attentions were indefatigable but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill he wished me to seek amusement in society i abhorred the face of man oh not abhorred they were my brethren my fellow beings and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride “alas my father” said i “how little do you know me human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine was as innocent as i and she suffered the same charge she died for it and i am the cause of this—i murdered her william justine and henry—they all died by my hands” my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i preserved in my convalescence i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe upon this occasion my father said with an expression of unbounded wonder “my dearest victor what infatuation is this my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again” “i am not mad” i cried energetically “the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth i am the assassin of those most innocent victims they died by my machinations a thousand times would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race” the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes sufficient for me was the consciousness of them by the utmost selfviolence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland i received the following letter from elizabeth “my dear friend “it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity “yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain if you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation and in a probability of this being the case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence i have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin “you well know victor that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy we were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place we were affectionate playfellows during childhood and i believe dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older but as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be our case tell me dearest victor answer me i conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truth—do you not love another “you have travelled you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt and i confess to you my friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying to solitude from the society of every creature i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations but this is false reasoning i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice even now i weep to think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word honour all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes ah victor be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one request remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity “do not let this letter disturb you do not answer tomorrow or the next day or even until you come if it will give you pain my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness “elizabeth lavenza “geneva may 18th 17—” this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten the threat of the fiend—“i will be with you on your weddingnight” such was my sentence and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings on that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death well be it so a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place in which if he were victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end if he were vanquished i should be a free man alas what freedom such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste and he is turned adrift homeless penniless and alone but free such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy but the apple was already eaten and the angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge he had vowed to be with me on my weddingnight yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father’s happiness my adversary’s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth my letter was calm and affectionate “i fear my beloved girl” i said “little happiness remains for us on earth yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment i have one secret elizabeth a dreadful one when revealed to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured i will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confidence between us but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude to it this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply” in about a week after the arrival of elizabeth’s letter we returned to geneva the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks i saw a change in her also she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i was the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure memory brought madness with it and when i thought of what had passed a real insanity possessed me sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage sometimes low and despondent i neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor she wept with me and for me when reason returned she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned but for the guilty there is no peace the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with elizabeth i remained silent “have you then some other attachment” “none on earth i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight let the day therefore be fixed and on it i will consecrate myself in life or death to the happiness of my cousin” “my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune and when time shall have softened your despair new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived” such were the lessons of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood i should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words “i shall be with you on your weddingnight” i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it and i therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as i imagined the seal to my fate great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage but as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real intentions and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death i hastened that of a far dearer victim as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink within me but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the everwatchful and nicer eye of elizabeth she looked forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were received and all wore a smiling appearance i shut up as well as i could in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy through my father’s exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her it was agreed that immediately after our union we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent elizabeth seemed happy my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny she was melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervaded her and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father’s but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day the day was fair the wind favourable all smiled on our nuptial embarkation those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness we passed rapidly along the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont salêve the pleasant banks of montalègre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it i took the hand of elizabeth “you are sorrowful my love ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy” “be happy my dear victor” replied elizabeth “there is i hope nothing to distress you and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is contented something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us but i will not listen to such a sinister voice observe how fast we move along and how the clouds which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears” thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects but her temper was fluctuating joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie the sun sank lower in the heavens we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills the alps here come closer to the lake and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary the spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung the wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as i touched the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever chapter 23 it was eight o’clock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind i was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom every sound terrified me but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her and trembling she asked “what is it that agitates you my dear victor what is it you fear” “oh peace peace my love” replied i “this night and all will be safe but this night is dreadful very dreadful” i passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflected how fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife and i earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy she left me and i continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant the scream was repeated and i rushed into the room great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated for a moment only did i lose recollection i fell senseless on the ground when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have supposed her asleep i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look up the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife i rushed towards the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom fired but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room i pointed to the spot where he had disappeared and we followed the track with boats nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house but my head whirled round my steps were like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind but my thoughts rambled to various subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night i hired men to row and took an oar myself for i had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise but the overflowing misery i now felt and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion i threw down the oar and leaning my head upon my hands gave way to every gloomy idea that arose if i looked up i saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection tears streamed from my eyes the rain had ceased for a moment and i saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before they had then been observed by elizabeth nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change the sun might shine or the clouds might lower but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore i see him now excellent and venerable old man his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm and their delight—his elizabeth his more than daughter whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels who in the decline of life having few affections clings more earnestly to those that remain cursed cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way he was unable to rise from his bed and in a few days he died in my arms what then became of me i know not i lost sensation and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation liberty however had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awakened to reason at the same time awakened to revenge as the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me i began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom i had created the miserable dæmon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose about a month after my release i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness “be assured sir” said he “no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain” “i thank you” replied i “listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make it is indeed a tale so strange that i should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood” my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm i had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested i saw him sometimes shudder with horror at others a lively surprise unmingled with disbelief was painted on his countenance when i had concluded my narration i said “this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power it is your duty as a magistrate and i believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion” this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity returned he however answered mildly “i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude besides some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit” “i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert” as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated “you are mistaken” said he “i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment” “that cannot be but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction” i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed but to a genevan magistrate whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium “man” i cried “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease you know not what it is you say” i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action chapter 24 my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dared not die and leave my adversary in being when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair they were dead and i lived their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed “by the sacred earth on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpose i will preserve my life to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me” i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains reechoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a wellknown and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper “i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied” i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task guided by a slight clue i followed the windings of the rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appeared and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i took my passage in the same ship but he escaped i know not how amidst the wilds of tartary and russia although he still evaded me i have ever followed in his track sometimes the peasants scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigue were the least pains which i was destined to endure i was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had invoked to aid me often when all was dry the heavens cloudless and i was parched by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drops that revived me and vanish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the dæmon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected in other places human beings were seldom seen and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it or i brought with me some food that i had killed which after taking a small part i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprived of this respite i should have sunk under my hardships during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeth’s voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know sometimes indeed he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury “my reign is not yet over”—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—“you live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare eat and be refreshed come on my enemy we have yet to wrestle for our lives but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive” scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy shall i join my elizabeth and my departed friends who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage as i still pursued my journey to the northward the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hidingplaces to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours one inscription that he left was in these words “prepare your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred” my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words i resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe to meet and grapple with him some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed i know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but i found that as before i had daily lost ground in the pursuit i now gained on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horrorstruck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair he had escaped me and i must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge i prepared for my journey i exchanged my landsledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage and i often heard the thunder of the ground sea which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a wellknown form within oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dæmon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud but this was not the time for delay i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hour’s rest which was absolutely necessary and yet which was bitterly irksome to me i continued my route the sledge was still visible nor did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some icerock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days’ journey i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before a ground sea was heard the thunder of its progress as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more ominous and terrific i pressed on but in vain the wind arose the sea roared and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death in this manner many appalling hours passed several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i had determined if you were going southwards still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the dæmon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no i am not so selfish yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart but trust him not his soul is as hellish as his form full of treachery and fiendlike malice hear him not call on the names of william justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart i will hover near and direct the steel aright walton in continuation august 26th 17— you have read this strange and terrific story margaret and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdles mine sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish his fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice suppressing every mark of agitation then like a volcano bursting forth his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie which he showed me and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations however earnest and connected such a monster has then really existence i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surprise and admiration sometimes i endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his creature’s formation but on this point he was impenetrable “are you mad my friend” said he “or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy peace peace learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own” frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy “since you have preserved my narration” said he “i would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity” thus has a week passed away while i have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live oh no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death yet he enjoys one comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance that they are not the creations of his fancy but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension his eloquence is forcible and touching nor can i hear him when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love without tears what a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin he seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall “when younger” said he “i believed myself destined for some great enterprise my feelings are profound but i possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements this sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures when i reflected on the work i had completed no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors but this thought which supported me in the commencement of my career now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust all my speculations and hopes are as nothing and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence i am chained in an eternal hell my imagination was vivid yet my powers of analysis and application were intense by the union of these qualities i conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man even now i cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete i trod heaven in my thoughts now exulting in my powers now burning with the idea of their effects from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i once was you would not recognise me in this state of degradation despondency rarely visited my heart a high destiny seemed to bear me on until i fell never never again to rise” must i then lose this admirable being i have longed for a friend i have sought one who would sympathise with and love me behold on these desert seas i have found such a one but i fear i have gained him only to know his value and lose him i would reconcile him to life but he repulses the idea “i thank you walton” he said “for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone can any man be to me as clerval was or any woman another elizabeth even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain they know our infantine dispositions which however they may be afterwards modified are never eradicated and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however strongly he may be attached may in spite of himself be contemplated with suspicion but i enjoyed friends dear not only through habit and association but from their own merits and wherever i am the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear they are dead and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life if i were engaged in any high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures then could i live to fulfil it but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die” my beloved sister september 2d i write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel the brave fellows whom i have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow there is something terribly appalling in our situation yet my courage and hopes do not desert me yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me if we are lost my mad schemes are the cause and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear of my destruction and you will anxiously await my return years will pass and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope oh my beloved sister the sickening failing of your heartfelt expectations is in prospect more terrible to me than my own death but you have a husband and lovely children you may be happy heaven bless you and make you so my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued he reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea and in spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence when he speaks they no longer despair he rouses their energies and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are molehills which will vanish before the resolutions of man these feelings are transitory each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair september 5th a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you yet i cannot forbear recording it we are still surrounded by mountains of ice still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict the cold is excessive and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation frankenstein has daily declined in health a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is exhausted and when suddenly roused to any exertion he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny this morning as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—i was roused by half a dozen of the sailors who demanded admission into the cabin they entered and their leader addressed me he told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which in justice i could not refuse we were immured in ice and should probably never escape but they feared that if as was possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this they insisted therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards this speech troubled me i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free yet could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had at first been silent and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now roused himself his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour turning towards the men he said “what do you mean what do you demand of your captain are you then so easily turned from your design did you not call this a glorious expedition “and wherefore was it glorious not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea but because it was full of dangers and terror because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited because danger and death surrounded it and these you were to brave and overcome for this was it a glorious for this was it an honourable undertaking you were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now behold with the first imagination of danger or if you will the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril and so poor souls they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides why that requires not this preparation ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards oh be men or be more than men be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe” he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism that can you wonder that these men were moved they looked at one another and were unable to reply i spoke i told them to retire and consider of what had been said that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary but that i hoped that with reflection their courage would return they retired and i turned towards my friend but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life how all this will terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled yet i fear such will be my fate the men unsupported by ideas of glory and honour can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships september 7th the die is cast i have consented to return if we are not destroyed thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision i come back ignorant and disappointed it requires more philosophy than i possess to bear this injustice with patience september 12th it is past i am returning to england i have lost my hopes of utility and glory i have lost my friend but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond september 9th the ice began to move and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction we were in the most imminent peril but as we could only remain passive my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed the ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north a breeze sprang from the west and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them loud and longcontinued frankenstein who was dozing awoke and asked the cause of the tumult “they shout” i said “because they will soon return to england” “do you then really return” “alas yes i cannot withstand their demands i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger and i must return” “do so if you will but i will not you may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength” saying this he endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him he fell back and fainted it was long before he was restored and i often thought that life was entirely extinct at length he opened his eyes he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live his sentence was pronounced and i could only grieve and be patient i sat by his bed watching him his eyes were closed and i thought he slept but presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said “alas the strength i relied on is gone i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and persecutor may still be in being think not walton that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do i find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness and wellbeing this was my duty but there was another still paramount to that my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery urged by this view i refused and i did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil he destroyed my friends he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations happiness and wisdom nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end miserable himself that he may render no other wretched he ought to die the task of his destruction was mine but i have failed when actuated by selfish and vicious motives i asked you to undertake my unfinished work and i renew this request now when i am only induced by reason and virtue “yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task and now that you are returning to england you will have little chance of meeting with him but the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties i leave to you my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may still be misled by passion “that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me in other respects this hour when i momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years the forms of the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arms farewell walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries yet why do i say this i have myself been blasted in these hopes yet another may succeed” his voice became fainter as he spoke and at length exhausted by his effort he sank into silence about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble my tears flow my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment but i journey towards england and i may there find consolation i am interrupted what do these sounds portend it is midnight the breeze blows fairly and the watch on deck scarcely stir again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie i must arise and examine good night my sister great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion “that is also my victim” he exclaimed “in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me” his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent selfreproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion “your repentance” i said “is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived” “and do you dream” said the dæmon “do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he” he continued pointing to the corpse “he suffered not in the consummation of the deed oh not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine “after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heartbroken and overcome i pitied frankenstein my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended there is my last victim” i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me “wretch” i said “it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity that you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power” “oh it is not thus—not thus” interrupted the being “yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed that i wished to be participated but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure when i die i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation i am alone “you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they were for ever ardent and craving still i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned was there no injustice in this am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice “but it is true that i am a wretch i have murdered the lovely and the helpless i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men to misery i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin there he lies white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hands which executed the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more “fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief my work is nearly complete neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done but it requires my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied yet unquenched he is dead who called me into being and when i shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks light feeling and sense will pass away and in this condition must i find my happiness some years ago when the images which this world affords first opened upon me when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds and these were all to me i should have wept to die now it is my only consolation polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse where can i find rest but in death “farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction but it was not so thou didst seek my extinction that i might not cause greater wretchedness and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceased to think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel blasted as thou wert my agony was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever “but soon” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm “i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt soon these burning miseries will be extinct i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames the light of that conflagration will fade away my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds my spirit will sleep in peace or if it thinks it will not surely think thus farewell” he sprang from the cabinwindow as he said this upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel he was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance end of the project gutenberg ebook

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg™ ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg™ ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes information about

shock viii explanation ix the morlocks x when night came xi the palace of green porcelain xii in the darkness xiii the trap of the white sphinx xiv the further vision xv the time traveller’s return xvi after the story epilogue i introduction the time traveller for so it will be convenient to speak of him was expounding a recondite matter to us his pale grey eyes shone and twinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated the fire burnt brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon and there was that luxurious afterdinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision and he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox as we thought it and his fecundity “you must follow me carefully i shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted the geometry for instance they taught you at school is founded on a misconception” “is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon” said filby an argumentative person with red hair “i do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you know of course that a mathematical line a line of thickness nil has no real existence they taught you that neither has a mathematical plane these things are mere abstractions” “that is all right” said the psychologist “nor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have a real existence” “there i object” said filby “of course a solid body may exist all real things—” “so most people think but wait a moment can an instantaneous cube exist” “don’t follow you” said filby “can a cube that does not last for any time at all have a real existence” filby became pensive “clearly” the time traveller proceeded “any real body must have extension in four directions it must have length breadth thickness and—duration but through a natural infirmity of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we incline to overlook this fact there are really four dimensions three which we call the three planes of space and a fourth time there is however a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives” “that” said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp “that very clear indeed” “now it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked” continued the time traveller with a slight accession of cheerfulness “really this is what is meant by the fourth dimension though some people who talk about the fourth dimension do not know they mean it it is only another way of looking at time there is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it but some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea you have all heard what they have to say about this fourth dimension” “i have not” said the provincial mayor “it is simply this that space as our mathematicians have it is spoken of as having three dimensions which one may call length breadth and thickness and is always definable by reference to three planes each at right angles to the others but some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three—and have even tried to construct a fourdimensional geometry professor simon newcomb was expounding this to the new york mathematical society only a month or so ago you know how on a flat surface which has only two dimensions we can represent a figure of a threedimensional solid and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing see” “i think so” murmured the provincial mayor and knitting his brows he lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words “yes i think i see it now” he said after some time brightening in a quite transitory manner “well i do not mind telling you i have been at work upon this geometry of four dimensions for some time some of my results are curious for instance here is a portrait of a man at eight years old another at fifteen another at seventeen another at twentythree and so on all these are evidently sections as it were threedimensional representations of his fourdimensioned being which is a fixed and unalterable thing “scientific people” proceeded the time traveller after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this “know very well that time is only a kind of space here is a popular scientific diagram a weather record this line i trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to here surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of space generally recognised but certainly it traced such a line and that line therefore we must conclude was along the timedimension” “but” said the medical man staring hard at a coal in the fire “if time is really only a fourth dimension of space why is it and why has it always been regarded as something different and why cannot we move in time as we move about in the other dimensions of space” the time traveller smiled “are you so sure we can move freely in space right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done so i admit we move freely in two dimensions but how about up and down gravitation limits us there” “not exactly” said the medical man “there are balloons” “but before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical movement” “still they could move a little up and down” said the medical man “easier far easier down than up” “and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment” “my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the timedimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface” “but the great difficulty is this” interrupted the psychologist ’you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time” “that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absentminded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the timedimension or even turn about and travel the other way” “oh this” began filby “is all—” “why not” said the time traveller “it’s against reason” said filby “what reason” said the time traveller “you can show black is white by argument” said filby “but you will never convince me” “possibly not” said the time traveller “but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine—” “to travel through time” exclaimed the very young man “that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines” filby contented himself with laughter “but i have experimental verification” said the time traveller “it would be remarkably convenient for the historian” the psychologist suggested “one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance” “don’t you think you would attract attention” said the medical man “our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms” “one might get one’s greek from the very lips of homer and plato” the very young man thought “in which case they would certainly plough you for the littlego the german scholars have improved greek so much” “then there is the future” said the very young man “just think one might invest all one’s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead” “to discover a society” said i “erected on a strictly communistic basis” “of all the wild extravagant theories” began the psychologist “yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until—” “experimental verification” cried i “you are going to verify that” “the experiment” cried filby who was getting brainweary “let’s see your experiment anyhow” said the psychologist “though it’s all humbug you know” the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us “i wonder what he’s got” “some sleightofhand trick or other” said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby’s anecdote collapsed ii the machine the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low armchair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism “well” said the psychologist “this little affair” said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus “is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal” he pointed to the part with his finger “also here is one little white lever and here is another” the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing “it’s beautifully made” he said “it took two years to make” retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said “now i want you clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over sends the machine gliding into the future and this other reverses the motion this saddle represents the seat of a time traveller presently i am going to press the lever and off the machine will go it will vanish pass into future time and disappear have a good look at the thing look at the table too and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery i don’t want to waste this model and then be told i’m a quack” there was a minute’s pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about to speak to me but changed his mind then the time traveller put forth his finger towards the lever “no” he said suddenly “lend me your hand” and turning to the psychologist he took that individual’s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger so that it was the psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machine on its interminable voyage we all saw the lever turn i am absolutely certain there was no trickery there was a breath of wind and the lamp flame jumped one of the candles on the mantel was blown out and the little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory and it was gone—vanished save for the lamp the table was bare everyone was silent for a minute then filby said he was damned the psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked under the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully “well” he said with a reminiscence of the psychologist then getting up he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his back to us began to fill his pipe we stared at each other “look here” said the medical man “are you in earnest about this do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time” “certainly” said the time traveller stooping to light a spill at the fire then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the psychologist’s face the psychologist to show that he was not unhinged helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut “what is more i have a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the laboratory—“and when that is put together i mean to have a journey on my own account” “you mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future” said filby “into the future or the past—i don’t for certain know which” after an interval the psychologist had an inspiration “it must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere” he said “why” said the time traveller “because i presume that it has not moved in space and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time since it must have travelled through this time” “but” said i “if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room and last thursday when we were here and the thursday before that and so forth” “serious objections” remarked the provincial mayor with an air of impartiality turning towards the time traveller “not a bit” said the time traveller and to the psychologist “you think you can explain that it’s presentation below the threshold you know diluted presentation” “of course” said the psychologist and reassured us “that’s a simple point of psychology i should have thought of it it’s plain enough and helps the paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor can we appreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning or a bullet flying through the air if it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are if it gets through a minute while we get through a second the impression it creates will of course be only onefiftieth or onehundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time that’s plain enough” he passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been “you see” he said laughing we sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so then the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all “it sounds plausible enough tonight” said the medical man “but wait until tomorrow wait for the common sense of the morning” “would you like to see the time machine itself” asked the time traveller and therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the way down the long draughty corridor to his laboratory i remember vividly the flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette the dance of the shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes parts were of nickel parts of ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal the thing was generally complete but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings and i took one up for a better look at it quartz it seemed to be “look here” said the medical man “are you perfectly serious or is this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last christmas” “upon that machine” said the time traveller holding the lamp aloft “i intend to explore time is that plain i was never more serious in my life” none of us quite knew how to take it i caught filby’s eye over the shoulder of the medical man and he winked at me solemnly iii the time traveller returns i think that at that time none of us quite believed in the time machine the fact is the time traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed you never felt that you saw all round him you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown the model and explained the matter in the time traveller’s words we should have shown him far less scepticism for we should have perceived his motives a porkbutcher could understand filby but the time traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements and we distrusted him things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands it is a mistake to do things too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china so i don’t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that thursday and the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt in most of our minds its plausibility that is its practical incredibleness the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested for my own part i was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model that i remember discussing with the medical man whom i met on friday at the linnæan he said he had seen a similar thing at tübingen and laid considerable stress on the blowingout of the candle but how the trick was done he could not explain the next thursday i went again to richmond—i suppose i was one of the time traveller’s most constant guests—and arriving late found four or five men already assembled in his drawingroom the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other i looked round for the time traveller and—“it’s halfpast seven now” said the medical man “i suppose we’d better have dinner” “where’s——” said i naming our host “you’ve just come it’s rather odd he’s unavoidably detained he asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back says he’ll explain when he comes” “it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil” said the editor of a wellknown daily paper and thereupon the doctor rang the bell the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner the other men were blank the editor aforementioned a certain journalist and another—a quiet shy man with a beard—whom i didn’t know and who as far as my observation went never opened his mouth all the evening there was some speculation at the dinnertable about the time traveller’s absence and i suggested time travelling in a halfjocular spirit the editor wanted that explained to him and the psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week he was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise i was facing the door and saw it first “hallo” i said “at last” and the door opened wider and the time traveller stood before us i gave a cry of surprise “good heavens man what’s the matter” cried the medical man who saw him next and the whole tableful turned towards the door he was in an amazing plight his coat was dusty and dirty and smeared with green down the sleeves his hair disordered and as it seemed to me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded his face was ghastly pale his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut halfhealed his expression was haggard and drawn as by intense suffering for a moment he hesitated in the doorway as if he had been dazzled by the light then he came into the room he walked with just such a limp as i have seen in footsore tramps we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak he said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a motion towards the wine the editor filled a glass of champagne and pushed it towards him he drained it and it seemed to do him good for he looked round the table and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face “what on earth have you been up to man” said the doctor the time traveller did not seem to hear “don’t let me disturb you” he said with a certain faltering articulation “i’m all right” he stopped held out his glass for more and took it off at a draught “that’s good” he said his eyes grew brighter and a faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval and then went round the warm and comfortable room then he spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words “i’m going to wash and dress and then i’ll come down and explain things save me some of that mutton i’m starving for a bit of meat” he looked across at the editor who was a rare visitor and hoped he was all right the editor began a question “tell you presently” said the time traveller “i’m—funny be all right in a minute” he put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door again i remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall and standing up in my place i saw his feet as he went out he had nothing on them but a pair of tattered bloodstained socks then the door closed upon him i had half a mind to follow till i remembered how he detested any fuss about himself for a minute perhaps my mind was woolgathering then “remarkable behaviour of an eminent scientist” i heard the editor say thinking after his wont in headlines and this brought my attention back to the bright dinnertable “what’s the game” said the journalist “has he been doing the amateur cadger i don’t follow” i met the eye of the psychologist and read my own interpretation in his face i thought of the time traveller limping painfully upstairs i don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness the first to recover completely from this surprise was the medical man who rang the bell—the time traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner—for a hot plate at that the editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt and the silent man followed suit the dinner was resumed conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment and then the editor got fervent in his curiosity “does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing or has he his nebuchadnezzar phases” he inquired “i feel assured it’s this business of the time machine” i said and took up the psychologist’s account of our previous meeting the new guests were frankly incredulous the editor raised objections “what was this time travelling a man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox could he” and then as the idea came home to him he resorted to caricature hadn’t they any clothesbrushes in the future the journalist too would not believe at any price and joined the editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing they were both the new kind of journalist—very joyous irreverent young men “our special correspondent in the day after tomorrow reports” the journalist was saying—or rather shouting—when the time traveller came back he was dressed in ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me “i say” said the editor hilariously “these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week tell us all about little rosebery will you what will you take for the lot” the time traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word he smiled quietly in his old way “where’s my mutton” he said “what a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again” “story” cried the editor “story be damned” said the time traveller “i want something to eat i won’t say a word until i get some peptone into my arteries thanks and the salt” “one word” said i “have you been time travelling” “yes” said the time traveller with his mouth full nodding his head “i’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note” said the editor the time traveller pushed his glass towards the silent man and rang it with his fingernail at which the silent man who had been staring at his face started convulsively and poured him wine the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable for my own part sudden questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same with the others the journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of hettie potter the time traveller devoted his attention to his dinner and displayed the appetite of a tramp the medical man smoked a cigarette and watched the time traveller through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness at last the time traveller pushed his plate away and looked round us “i suppose i must apologise” he said “i was simply starving i’ve had a most amazing time” he reached out his hand for a cigar and cut the end “but come into the smokingroom it’s too long a story to tell over greasy plates” and ringing the bell in passing he led the way into the adjoining room “you have told blank and dash and chose about the machine” he said to me leaning back in his easychair and naming the three new guests “but the thing’s a mere paradox” said the editor “i can’t argue tonight i don’t mind telling you the story but i can’t argue i will” he went on “tell you the story of what has happened to me if you like but you must refrain from interruptions i want to tell it badly most of it will sound like lying so be it it’s true—every word of it all the same i was in my laboratory at four o’clock and since then … i’ve lived eight days … such days as no human being ever lived before i’m nearly worn out but i shan’t sleep till i’ve told this thing over to you then i shall go to bed but no interruptions is it agreed” “agreed” said the editor and the rest of us echoed “agreed” and with that the time traveller began his story as i have set it forth he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man afterwards he got more animated in writing it down i feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and above all my own inadequacy—to express its quality you read i will suppose attentively enough but you cannot see the speaker’s white sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp nor hear the intonation of his voice you cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story most of us hearers were in shadow for the candles in the smokingroom had not been lighted and only the face of the journalist and the legs of the silent man from the knees downward were illuminated at first we glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time traveller’s face iv time travelling “i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travelworn truly and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of it’s sound enough i expected to finish it on friday but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten o’clock today that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel i felt a nightmare sensation of falling and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly halfpast three “i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came tomorrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter tomorrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind “i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter fluctuating band and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue “the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hillside upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring “the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hillside and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping “the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so to speak attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a farreaching explosion—would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerves i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air “there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin ‘fine hospitality’ said i ‘to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you’ “presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible “my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birchtree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weatherworn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun “i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some oldworld savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently slain “already i saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again “but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me “then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature—perhaps four feet high—clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins—i could not clearly distinguish which—were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was “he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine v in the golden age “in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue “there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication “and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild and—this may seem egotism on my part—i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them “as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder “for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our fiveyearold children—asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain “i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind “the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons “the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old phœnician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weatherworn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenthcentury garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright softcoloured robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech “the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs—blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange “between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure “and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stainedglass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material “fruit by the bye was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there—a floury thing in a threesided husk—was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import “however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fairhaired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine if uncivil amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb ‘to eat’ but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued vi the sunset of mankind “a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices “the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known—even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one ad for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded “as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world—for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagodalike plants—nettles possibly—but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience—the first intimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that i will speak in its proper place “looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realised that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palacelike buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared “‘communism’ said i to myself “and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the halfdozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion “seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an efficient family and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to their children’s needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality “while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest “there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognise corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the armrests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins’ heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth had become a garden “so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way afterwards i found i had got only a half truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth “it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome of need security sets a premium on feebleness the work of ameliorating the conditions of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more secure—had gone steadily on to a climax one triumph of a united humanity over nature had followed another things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward and the harvest was what i saw “after all the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary stage the science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease but even so it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can we improve our favourite plants and animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding now a new and better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and larger flower now a more convenient breed of cattle we improve them gradually because our ideals are vague and tentative and our knowledge is very limited because nature too is shy and slow in our clumsy hands some day all this will be better organised and still better that is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies the whole world will be intelligent educated and cooperating things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of nature in the end wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs “this adjustment i say must have been done and done well done indeed for all time in the space of time across which my machine had leapt the air was free from gnats the earth from weeds or fungi everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither the ideal of preventive medicine was attained diseases had been stamped out i saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay and i shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes “social triumphs too had been effected i saw mankind housed in splendid shelters gloriously clothed and as yet i had found them engaged in no toil there were no signs of struggle neither social nor economical struggle the shop the advertisement traffic all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world was gone it was natural on that golden evening that i should jump at the idea of a social paradise the difficulty of increasing population had been met i guessed and population had ceased to increase “but with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change what unless biological science is a mass of errors is the cause of human intelligence and vigour hardship and freedom conditions under which the active strong and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men upon selfrestraint patience and decision and the institution of the family and the emotions that arise therein the fierce jealousy the tenderness for offspring parental selfdevotion all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young now where are these imminent dangers there is a sentiment arising and it will grow against connubial jealousy against fierce maternity against passion of all sorts unnecessary things now and things that make us uncomfortable savage survivals discords in a refined and pleasant life “i thought of the physical slightness of the people their lack of intelligence and those big abundant ruins and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of nature for after the battle comes quiet humanity had been strong energetic and intelligent and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived and now came the reaction of the altered conditions “under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security that restless energy that with us is strength would become weakness even in our own time certain tendencies and desires once necessary to survival are a constant source of failure physical courage and the love of battle for instance are no great help—may even be hindrances—to a civilised man and in a state of physical balance and security power intellectual as well as physical would be out of place for countless years i judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence no danger from wild beasts no wasting disease to require strength of constitution no need of toil for such a life what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong are indeed no longer weak better equipped indeed they are for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet no doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings i saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace this has ever been the fate of energy in security it takes to art and to eroticism and then come languor and decay “even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in the time i saw to adorn themselves with flowers to dance to sing in the sunlight so much was left of the artistic spirit and no more even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity we are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last “as i stood there in the gathering dark i thought that in this simple explanation i had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole secret of these delicious people possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary that would account for the abandoned ruins very simple was my explanation and plausible enough—as most wrong theories are vii a sudden shock “as i stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man the full moon yellow and gibbous came up out of an overflow of silver light in the northeast the bright little figures ceased to move about below a noiseless owl flitted by and i shivered with the chill of the night i determined to descend and find where i could sleep “i looked for the building i knew then my eye travelled along to the figure of the white sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter i could see the silver birch against it there was the tangle of rhododendron bushes black in the pale light and there was the little lawn i looked at the lawn again a queer doubt chilled my complacency ‘no’ said i stoutly to myself ‘that was not the lawn’ “but it was the lawn for the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it can you imagine what i felt as this conviction came home to me but you cannot the time machine was gone “at once like a lash across the face came the possibility of losing my own age of being left helpless in this strange new world the bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation i could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing in another moment i was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope once i fell headlong and cut my face i lost no time in stanching the blood but jumped up and ran on with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin all the time i ran i was saying to myself ‘they have moved it a little pushed it under the bushes out of the way’ nevertheless i ran with all my might all the time with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread i knew that such assurance was folly knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach my breath came with pain i suppose i covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn two miles perhaps in ten minutes and i am not a young man i cursed aloud as i ran at my confident folly in leaving the machine wasting good breath thereby i cried aloud and none answered not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world “when i reached the lawn my worst fears were realised not a trace of the thing was to be seen i felt faint and cold when i faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes i ran round it furiously as if the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly with my hands clutching my hair above me towered the sphinx upon the bronze pedestal white shining leprous in the light of the rising moon it seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay “i might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me had i not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy that is what dismayed me the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power through whose intervention my invention had vanished yet for one thing i felt assured unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate the machine could not have moved in time the attachment of the levers—i will show you the method later—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they were removed it had moved and was hid only in space but then where could it be “i think i must have had a kind of frenzy i remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx and startling some white animal that in the dim light i took for a small deer i remember too late that night beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs then sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind i went down to the great building of stone the big hall was dark silent and deserted i slipped on the uneven floor and fell over one of the malachite tables almost breaking my shin i lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains of which i have told you “there i found a second great hall covered with cushions upon which perhaps a score or so of the little people were sleeping i have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match for they had forgotten about matches ‘where is my time machine’ i began bawling like an angry child laying hands upon them and shaking them up together it must have been very queer to them some laughed most of them looked sorely frightened when i saw them standing round me it came into my head that i was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances in trying to revive the sensation of fear for reasoning from their daylight behaviour i thought that fear must be forgotten “abruptly i dashed down the match and knocking one of the people over in my course went blundering across the big dininghall again out under the moonlight i heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that i do not remember all i did as the moon crept up the sky i suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me i felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a strange animal in an unknown world i must have raved to and fro screaming and crying upon god and fate i have a memory of horrible fatigue as the long night of despair wore away of looking in this impossible place and that of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows at last of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength i had nothing left but misery then i slept and when i woke again it was full day and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm “i sat up in the freshness of the morning trying to remember how i had got there and why i had such a profound sense of desertion and despair then things came clear in my mind with the plain reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly in the face i saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight and i could reason with myself ‘suppose the worst’ i said ‘suppose the machine altogether lost—perhaps destroyed it behoves me to be calm and patient to learn the way of the people to get a clear idea of the method of my loss and the means of getting materials and tools so that in the end perhaps i may make another’ that would be my only hope a poor hope perhaps but better than despair and after all it was a beautiful and curious world “but probably the machine had only been taken away still i must be calm and patient find its hidingplace and recover it by force or cunning and with that i scrambled to my feet and looked about me wondering where i could bathe i felt weary stiff and travelsoiled the freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness i had exhausted my emotion indeed as i went about my business i found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight i made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn i wasted some time in futile questionings conveyed as well as i was able to such of the little people as came by they all failed to understand my gestures some were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at me i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces it was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity the turf gave better counsel i found a groove ripped in it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where on arrival i had struggled with the overturned machine there were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprints like those i could imagine made by a sloth this directed my closer attention to the pedestal it was as i think i have said of bronze it was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side i went and rapped at these the pedestal was hollow examining the panels with care i found them discontinuous with the frames there were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels if they were doors as i supposed opened from within one thing was clear enough to my mind it took no very great mental effort to infer that my time machine was inside that pedestal but how it got there was a different problem “i saw the heads of two orangeclad people coming through the bushes and under some blossomcovered appletrees towards me i turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me they came and then pointing to the bronze pedestal i tried to intimate my wish to open it but at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly i don’t know how to convey their expression to you suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicateminded woman—it is how she would look they went off as if they had received the last possible insult i tried a sweetlooking little chap in white next with exactly the same result somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me in three strides i was after him had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx then i saw the horror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden i let him go “but i was not beaten yet i banged with my fist at the bronze panels i thought i heard something stir inside—to be explicit i thought i heard a sound like a chuckle—but i must have been mistaken then i got a big pebble from the river and came and hammered till i had flattened a coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes the delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it i saw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place but i was too restless to watch long i am too occidental for a long vigil i could work at a problem for years but to wait inactive for twentyfour hours—that is another matter “i got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again ‘patience’ said i to myself ‘if you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone if they mean to take your machine away it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels and if they don’t you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it to sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless that way lies monomania face this world learn its ways watch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning in the end you will find clues to it all’ then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind the thought of the years i had spent in study and toil to get into the future age and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised although it was at my own expense i could not help myself i laughed aloud “going through the big palace it seemed to me that the little people avoided me it may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze yet i felt tolerably sure of the avoidance i was careful however to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing i made what progress i could in the language and in addition i pushed my explorations here and there either i missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs there seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use of figurative language their sentences were usually simple and of two words and i failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions i determined to put the thought of my time machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way yet a certain feeling you may understand tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival viii explanation “so far as i could see all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the thames valley from every hill i climbed i saw the same abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style the same clustering thickets of evergreens the same blossomladen trees and tree ferns here and there water shone like silver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and so faded into the serenity of the sky a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wells several as it seemed to me of a very great depth one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk like the others it was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a little cupola from the rain sitting by the side of these wells and peering down into the shafted darkness i could see no gleam of water nor could i start any reflection with a lighted match but in all of them i heard a certain sound a thud—thud—thud like the beating of some big engine and i discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steady current of air set down the shafts further i threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight “after a time too i came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sunscorched beach putting things together i reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whose true import it was difficult to imagine i was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong “and here i must admit that i learnt very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time in this real future in some of these visions of utopias and coming times which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about building and social arrangements and so forth but while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s imagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as i found here conceive the tale of london which a negro fresh from central africa would take back to his tribe what would he know of railway companies of social movements of telephone and telegraph wires of the parcels delivery company and postal orders and the like yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him and even of what he knew how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe then think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times and how wide the interval between myself and these of the golden age i was sensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfort but save for a general impression of automatic organisation i fear i can convey very little of the difference to your mind “in the matter of sepulture for instance i could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs but it occurred to me that possibly there might be cemeteries or crematoria somewhere beyond the range of my explorings this again was a question i deliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point the thing puzzled me and i was led to make a further remark which puzzled me still more that aged and infirm among this people there were none “i must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure yet i could think of no other let me put my difficulties the several big palaces i had explored were mere living places great dininghalls and sleeping apartments i could find no machinery no appliances of any kind yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairly complex specimens of metalwork somehow such things must be made and the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency there were no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them they spent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river in making love in a halfplayful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping i could not see how things were kept going “then again about the time machine something i knew not what had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the white sphinx why for the life of me i could not imagine those waterless wells too those flickering pillars i felt i lacked a clue i felt—how shall i put it suppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there in excellent plain english and interpolated therewith others made up of words of letters even absolutely unknown to you well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me “that day too i made a friend—of a sort it happened that as i was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream the main current ran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer it will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in these creatures when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes when i realised this i hurriedly slipped off my clothes and wading in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her i had got to such a low estimate of her kind that i did not expect any gratitude from her in that however i was wrong “this happened in the morning in the afternoon i met my little woman as i believe it was as i was returning towards my centre from an exploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone the thing took my imagination very possibly i had been feeling desolate at any rate i did my best to display my appreciation of the gift we were soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged in conversation chiefly of smiles the creature’s friendliness affected me exactly as a child’s might have done we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands i did the same to hers then i tried talk and found that her name was weena which though i don’t know what it meant somehow seemed appropriate enough that was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week and ended—as i will tell you “she was exactly like a child she wanted to be with me always she tried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively but the problems of the world had to be mastered i had not i said to myself come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation yet her distress when i left her was very great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic and i think altogether i had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort i thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me until it was too late i did not clearly know what i had inflicted upon her when i left her nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me for by merely seeming fond of me and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming home and i would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill “it was from her too that i learnt that fear had not yet left the world she was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest confidence in me for once in a foolish moment i made threatening grimaces at her and she simply laughed at them but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things darkness to her was the one thing dreadful it was a singularly passionate emotion and it set me thinking and observing i discovered then among other things that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark and slept in droves to enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark yet i was still such a blockhead that i missed the lesson of that fear and in spite of weena’s distress i insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes “it troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance including the last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm but my story slips away from me as i speak of her it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn i had been restless dreaming most disagreeably that i was drowned and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps i woke with a start and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable it was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cut and yet unreal i got up and went down into the great hall and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace i thought i would make a virtue of necessity and see the sunrise “the moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly halflight the bushes were inky black the ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts three several times as i scanned the slope i saw white figures twice i fancied i saw a solitary white apelike creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body they moved hastily i did not see what became of them it seemed that they vanished among the bushes the dawn was still indistinct you must understand i was feeling that chill uncertain earlymorning feeling you may have known i doubted my eyes “as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more i scanned the view keenly but i saw no vestige of my white figures they were mere creatures of the halflight ‘they must have been ghosts’ i said ‘i wonder whence they dated’ for a queer notion of grant allen’s came into my head and amused me if each generation die and leave ghosts he argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them on that theory they would have grown innumerable some eight hundred thousand years hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once but the jest was unsatisfying and i was thinking of these figures all the morning until weena’s rescue drove them out of my head i associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal i had startled in my first passionate search for the time machine but weena was a pleasant substitute yet all the same they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind “i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age i cannot account for it it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it “well one very hot morning—my fourth i think—as i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me suddenly i halted spellbound a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness “the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs i was afraid to turn then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke i will admit that my voice was harsh and illcontrolled i put out my hand and touched something soft at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little apelike figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry “my impression of it is of course imperfect but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyishred eyes also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly i cannot even say whether it ran on all fours or only with its forearms held very low after an instant’s pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins i could not find it at first but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round welllike openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar a sudden thought came to me could this thing have vanished down the shaft i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated it made me shudder it was so like a human spider it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared “i do not know how long i sat peering down that well it was not for some time that i could succeed in persuading myself that the thing i had seen was human but gradually the truth dawned on me that man had not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinct animals that my graceful children of the upper world were not the sole descendants of our generation but that this bleached obscene nocturnal thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all the ages “i thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation i began to suspect their true import and what i wondered was this lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation how was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful overworlders and what was hidden down there at the foot of that shaft i sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at any rate there was nothing to fear and that there i must descend for the solution of my difficulties and withal i was absolutely afraid to go as i hesitated two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow the male pursued the female flinging flowers at her as he ran “they seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturned pillar peering down the well apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures for when i pointed to this one and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue they were still more visibly distressed and turned away but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them i tried them again about the well and again i failed so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her but my mind was already in revolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment i had now a clue to the import of these wells to the ventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the time machine and very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me “here was the new view plainly this second species of man was subterranean there were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a longcontinued underground habit in the first place there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the white fish of the kentucky caves for instance then those large eyes with that capacity for reflecting light are common features of nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat and last of all that evident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina “beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race the presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere in fact except along the river valley—showed how universal were its ramifications what so natural then as to assume that it was in this artificial underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done the notion was so plausible that i at once accepted it and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species i dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory though for myself i very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth “at first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the capitalist and the labourer was the key to the whole position no doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you—and wildly incredible—and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way there is a tendency to utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation there is the metropolitan railway in london for instance there are new electric railways there are subways there are underground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiply evidently i thought this tendency had increased till industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky i mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories spending a stillincreasing amount of its time therein till in the end— even now does not an eastend worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth “again the exclusive tendency of richer people—due no doubt to the increasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the closing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface of the land about london for instance perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion and this same widening gulf—which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification less and less frequent so in the end above ground you must have the haves pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground the havenots the workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour once they were there they would no doubt have to pay rent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns and if they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and as happy in their way as the overworld people were to theirs as it seemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough “the great triumph of humanity i had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind it had been no such triumph of moral education and general cooperation as i had imagined instead i saw a real aristocracy armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature but a triumph over nature and the fellowman this i must warn you was my theory at the time i had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the utopian books my explanation may be absolutely wrong i still think it is the most plausible one but even on this supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decay the tooperfect security of the overworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength and intelligence that i could see clearly enough already what had happened to the undergrounders i did not yet suspect but from what i had seen of the morlocks—that by the bye was the name by which these creatures were called—i could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the ‘eloi’ the beautiful race that i already knew “then came troublesome doubts why had the morlocks taken my time machine for i felt sure it was they who had taken it why too if the eloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark i proceeded as i have said to question weena about this underworld but here again i was disappointed at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them she shivered as though the topic was unendurable and when i pressed her perhaps a little harshly she burst into tears they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age when i saw them i ceased abruptly to trouble about the morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from weena’s eyes and very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands while i solemnly burnt a match ix the morlocks “it may seem odd to you but it was two days before i could follow up the newfound clue in what was manifestly the proper way i felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies they were just the halfbleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum and they were filthily cold to the touch probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the eloi whose disgust of the morlocks i now began to appreciate “the next night i did not sleep well probably my health was a little disordered i was oppressed with perplexity and doubt once or twice i had a feeling of intense fear for which i could perceive no definite reason i remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night weena was among them—and feeling reassured by their presence it occurred to me even then that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below these whitened lemurs this new vermin that had replaced the old might be more abundant and on both these days i had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty i felt assured that the time machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground yet i could not face the mystery if only i had had a companion it would have been different but i was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me i don’t know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back “it was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove me farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions going to the southwestward towards the rising country that is now called combe wood i observed faroff in the direction of nineteenthcentury banstead a vast green structure different in character from any i had hitherto seen it was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins i knew and the façade had an oriental look the face of it having the lustre as well as the palegreen tint a kind of bluishgreen of a certain type of chinese porcelain this difference in aspect suggested a difference in use and i was minded to push on and explore but the day was growing late and i had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit so i resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day and i returned to the welcome and the caresses of little weena but next morning i perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the palace of green porcelain was a piece of selfdeception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience i dreaded i resolved i would make the descent without further waste of time and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium “little weena ran with me she danced beside me to the well but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangely disconcerted ‘goodbye little weena’ i said kissing her and then putting her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks rather hastily i may as well confess for i feared my courage might leak away at first she watched me in amazement then she gave a most piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with her little hands i think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed i shook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment i was in the throat of the well i saw her agonised face over the parapet and smiled to reassure her then i had to look down at the unstable hooks to which i clung “i had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards the descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself i was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent and not simply fatigued one of the bars bent suddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again though my arms and back were presently acutely painful i went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible glancing upward i saw the aperture a small blue disc in which a star was visible while little weena’s head showed as a round black projection the thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive everything save that little disc above was profoundly dark and when i looked up again weena had disappeared “i was in an agony of discomfort i had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again and leave the underworld alone but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend at last with intense relief i saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me a slender loophole in the wall swinging myself in i found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which i could lie down and rest it was not too soon my arms ached my back was cramped and i was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall besides this the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes the air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft “i do not know how long i lay i was arroused by a soft hand touching my face starting up in the darkness i snatched at my matches and hastily striking one i saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one i had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating before the light living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in the same way i have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light but so soon as i struck a match in order to see them they fled incontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion “i tried to call to them but the language they had was apparently different from that of the overworld people so that i was needs left to my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind but i said to myself ‘you are in for it now’ and feeling my way along the tunnel i found the noise of machinery grow louder presently the walls fell away from me and i came to a large open space and striking another match saw that i had entered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match “necessarily my memory is vague great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dim spectral morlocks sheltered from the glare the place by the bye was very stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshlyshed blood was in the air some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal laid with what seemed a meal the morlocks at any rate were carnivorous even at the time i remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint i saw it was all very indistinct the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscene figures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again then the match burnt down and stung my fingers and fell a wriggling red spot in the blackness “i have thought since how particularly illequipped i was for such an experience when i had started with the time machine i had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances i had come without arms without medicine without anything to smoke—at times i missed tobacco frightfully—even without enough matches if only i had thought of a kodak i could have flashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second and examined it at leisure but as it was i stood there with only the weapons and the powers that nature had endowed me with—hands feet and teeth these and four safetymatches that still remained to me “i was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark and it was only with my last glimpse of light i discovered that my store of matches had run low it had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economise them and i had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the overworlders to whom fire was a novelty now as i say i had four left and while i stood in the dark a hand touched mine lank fingers came feeling over my face and i was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour i fancied i heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me i felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing the sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant the sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness i shouted at them as loudly as i could they started away and then i could feel them approaching me again they clutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other i shivered violently and shouted again—rather discordantly this time they were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me i will confess i was horribly frightened i determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare i did so and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket i made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel but i had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness i could hear the morlocks rustling like wind among leaves and pattering like the rain as they hurried after me “in a moment i was clutched by several hands and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back i struck another light and waved it in their dazzled faces you can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale chinless faces and great lidless pinkishgrey eyes—as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment but i did not stay to look i promise you i retreated again and when my second match had ended i struck my third it had almost burnt through when i reached the opening into the shaft i lay down on the edge for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy then i felt sideways for the projecting hooks and as i did so my feet were grasped from behind and i was violently tugged backward i lit my last match … and it incontinently went out but i had my hand on the climbing bars now and kicking violently i disengaged myself from the clutches of the morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft while they stayed peering and blinking up at me all but one little wretch who followed me for some way and wellnigh secured my boot as a trophy “that climb seemed interminable to me with the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me i had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold the last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness several times my head swam and i felt all the sensations of falling at last however i got over the wellmouth somehow and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight i fell upon my face even the soil smelt sweet and clean then i remember weena kissing my hands and ears and the voices of others among the eloi then for a time i was insensible x when night came “now indeed i seemed in a worse case than before hitherto except during my night’s anguish at the loss of the time machine i had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries hitherto i had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people and by some unknown forces which i had only to understand to overcome but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the morlocks—a something inhuman and malign instinctively i loathed them before i had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it now i felt like a beast in a trap whose enemy would come upon him soon “the enemy i dreaded may surprise you it was the darkness of the new moon weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the dark nights it was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming dark nights might mean the moon was on the wane each night there was a longer interval of darkness and i now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little upperworld people for the dark i wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the morlocks did under the new moon i felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong the upperworld people might once have been the favoured aristocracy and the morlocks their mechanical servants but that had long since passed away the two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards or had already arrived at an altogether new relationship the eloi like the carlovignan kings had decayed to a mere beautiful futility they still possessed the earth on sufferance since the morlocks subterranean for innumerable generations had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable and the morlocks made their garments i inferred and maintained them in their habitual needs perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service they did it as a standing horse paws with his foot or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism but clearly the old order was already in part reversed the nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace ages ago thousands of generations ago man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine and now that brother was coming back—changed already the eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew they were becoming reacquainted with fear and suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat i had seen in the underworld it seemed odd how it floated into my mind not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations but coming in almost like a question from outside i tried to recall the form of it i had a vague sense of something familiar but i could not tell what it was at the time “still however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious fear i was differently constituted i came out of this age of ours this ripe prime of the human race when fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors i at least would defend myself without further delay i determined to make myself arms and a fastness where i might sleep with that refuge as a base i could face this strange world with some of that confidence i had lost in realising to what creatures night by night i lay exposed i felt i could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them i shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me “i wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the thames but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible all the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the morlocks to judge by their wells must be then the tall pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory and in the evening taking weena like a child upon my shoulder i went up the hills towards the southwest the distance i had reckoned was seven or eight miles but it must have been nearer eighteen i had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished in addition the heel of one of my shoes was loose and a nail was working through the sole—they were comfortable old shoes i wore about indoors—so that i was lame and it was already long past sunset when i came in sight of the palace silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky “weena had been hugely delighted when i began to carry her but after a while she desired me to let her down and ran along by the side of me occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets my pockets had always puzzled weena but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral decoration at least she utilised them for that purpose and that reminds me in changing my jacket i found…” the time traveller paused put his hand into his pocket and silently placed two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows upon the little table then he resumed his narrative “as the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards wimbledon weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone but i pointed out the distant pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain to her and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her fear you know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk even the breeze stops in the trees to me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness the sky was clear remote and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset well that night the expectation took the colour of my fears in that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened i fancied i could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet could indeed almost see through it the morlocks on their anthill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark in my excitement i fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war and why had they taken my time machine “so we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepened into night the clear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came out the ground grew dim and the trees black weena’s fears and her fatigue grew upon her i took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neck and closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder so we went down a long slope into a valley and there in the dimness i almost walked into a little river this i waded and went up the opposite side of the valley past a number of sleeping houses and by a statue—a faun or some such figure minus the head here too were acacias so far i had seen nothing of the morlocks but it was yet early in the night and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come “from the brow of the next hill i saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me i hesitated at this i could see no end to it either to the right or the left feeling tired—my feet in particular were very sore—i carefully lowered weena from my shoulder as i halted and sat down upon the turf i could no longer see the palace of green porcelain and i was in doubt of my direction i looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars even were there no other lurking danger—a danger i did not care to let my imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the treeboles to strike against i was very tired too after the excitements of the day so i decided that i would not face it but would pass the night upon the open hill “weena i was glad to find was fast asleep i carefully wrapped her in my jacket and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise the hillside was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things above me shone the stars for the night was very clear i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling all the old constellations had gone from the sky however that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings but the milky way it seemed to me was still the same tattered streamer of stardust as of yore southward as i judged it was a very bright red star that was new to me it was even more splendid than our own green sirius and amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend “looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life i thought of their unfathomable distance and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future i thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that i had traversed and during these few revolutions all the activity all the traditions the complex organisations the nations languages literatures aspirations even the mere memory of man as i knew him had been swept out of existence instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry and the white things of which i went in terror then i thought of the great fear that was between the two species and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear knowledge of what the meat i had seen might be yet it was too horrible i looked at little weena sleeping beside me her face white and starlike under the stars and forthwith dismissed the thought “through that long night i held my mind off the morlocks as well as i could and whiled away the time by trying to fancy i could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion the sky kept very clear except for a hazy cloud or so no doubt i dozed at times then as my vigil wore on came a faintness in the eastward sky like the reflection of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin and peaked and white and close behind and overtaking it and overflowing it the dawn came pale at first and then growing pink and warm no morlocks had approached us indeed i had seen none upon the hill that night and in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable i stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel so i sat down again took off my shoes and flung them away “i awakened weena and we went down into the wood now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding we found some fruit wherewith to break our fast we soon met others of the dainty ones laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen i felt assured now of what it was and from the bottom of my heart i pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity clearly at some time in the longago of human decay the morlocks’ food had run short possibly they had lived on rats and suchlike vermin even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was—far less than any monkey his prejudice against human flesh is no deepseated instinct and so these inhuman sons of men—— i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit after all they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago and the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone why should i trouble myself these eloi were mere fatted cattle which the antlike morlocks preserved and preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of and there was weena dancing at my side “then i tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellowman had taken necessity as his watchword and excuse and in the fullness of time necessity had come home to him i even tried a carlylelike scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay but this attitude of mind was impossible however great their intellectual degradation the eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their fear “i had at that time very vague ideas as to the course i should pursue my first was to secure some safe place of refuge and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as i could contrive that necessity was immediate in the next place i hoped to procure some means of fire so that i should have the weapon of a torch at hand for nothing i knew would be more efficient against these morlocks then i wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the white sphinx i had in mind a battering ram i had a persuasion that if i could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me i should discover the time machine and escape i could not imagine the morlocks were strong enough to move it far away weena i had resolved to bring with me to our own time and turning such schemes over in my mind i pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling xi the palace of green porcelain “i found the palace of green porcelain when we approached it about noon deserted and falling into ruin only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework it lay very high upon a turfy down and looking northeastward before i entered it i was surprised to see a large estuary or even creek where i judged wandsworth and battersea must once have been i thought then—though i never followed up the thought—of what might have happened or might be happening to the living things in the sea “the material of the palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain and along the face of it i saw an inscription in some unknown character i thought rather foolishly that weena might help me to interpret this but i only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head she always seemed to me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection was so human “within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found instead of the customary hall a long gallery lit by many side windows at the first glance i was reminded of a museum the tiled floor was thick with dust and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering then i perceived standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton i recognised by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the megatherium the skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust and in one place where rainwater had dropped through a leak in the roof the thing itself had been worn away further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a brontosaurus my museum hypothesis was confirmed going towards the side i found what appeared to be sloping shelves and clearing away the thick dust i found the old familiar glass cases of our own time but they must have been airtight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents “clearly we stood among the ruins of some latterday south kensington here apparently was the palæontological section and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time and had through the extinction of bacteria and fungi lost ninetynine hundredths of its force was nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures here and there i found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds and the cases had in some instances been bodily removed—by the morlocks as i judged the place was very silent the thick dust deadened our footsteps weena who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case presently came as i stared about me and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me “and at first i was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that i gave no thought to the possibilities it presented even my preoccupation about the time machine receded a little from my mind “to judge from the size of the place this palace of green porcelain had a great deal more in it than a gallery of palæontology possibly historical galleries it might be even a library to me at least in my present circumstances these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay exploring i found another short gallery running transversely to the first this appeared to be devoted to minerals and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder but i could find no saltpetre indeed no nitrates of any kind doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago yet the sulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of thinking as for the rest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were the best preserved of all i saw i had little interest i am no specialist in mineralogy and i went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall i had entered apparently this section had been devoted to natural history but everything had long since passed out of recognition a few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit a brown dust of departed plants that was all i was sorry for that because i should have been glad to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions but singularly illlit the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which i entered at intervals white globes hung from the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit here i was more in my element for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines all greatly corroded and many broken down but some still fairly complete you know i have a certain weakness for mechanism and i was inclined to linger among these the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles and i could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for i fancied that if i could solve their puzzles i should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the morlocks “suddenly weena came very close to my side so suddenly that she startled me had it not been for her i do not think i should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all footnote it may be of course that the floor did not slope but that the museum was built into the side of a hill—ed the end i had come in at was quite above ground and was lit by rare slitlike windows as you went down the length the ground came up against these windows until at last there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a london house before each and only a narrow line of daylight at the top i went slowly along puzzling about the machines and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light until weena’s increasing apprehensions drew my attention then i saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness i hesitated and then as i looked round me i saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even further away towards the dimness it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints my sense of the immediate presence of the morlocks revived at that i felt that i was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery i called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refuge and no means of making a fire and then down in the remote blackness of the gallery i heard a peculiar pattering and the same odd noises i had heard down the well “i took weena’s hand then struck with a sudden idea i left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signalbox clambering upon the stand and grasping this lever in my hands i put all my weight upon it sideways suddenly weena deserted in the central aisle began to whimper i had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly for it snapped after a minute’s strain and i rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient i judged for any morlock skull i might encounter and i longed very much to kill a morlock or so very inhuman you may think to want to go killing one’s own descendants but it was impossible somehow to feel any humanity in the things only my disinclination to leave weena and a persuasion that if i began to slake my thirst for murder my time machine might suffer restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes i heard “well mace in one hand and weena in the other i went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags the brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it i presently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books they had long since dropped to pieces and every semblance of print had left them but here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough had i been a literary man i might perhaps have moralised upon the futility of all ambition but as it was the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified at the time i will confess that i thought chiefly of the philosophical transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics “then going up a broad staircase we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry and here i had not a little hope of useful discoveries except at one end where the roof had collapsed this gallery was well preserved i went eagerly to every unbroken case and at last in one of the really airtight cases i found a box of matches very eagerly i tried them they were perfectly good they were not even damp i turned to weena ‘dance’ i cried to her in her own tongue for now i had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared and so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpeting of dust to weena’s huge delight i solemnly performed a kind of composite dance whistling the land of the leal as cheerfully as i could in part it was a modest cancan in part a step dance in part a skirt dance so far as my tailcoat permitted and in part original for i am naturally inventive as you know “now i still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange as for me it was a most fortunate thing yet oddly enough i found a far unlikelier substance and that was camphor i found it in a sealed jar that by chance i suppose had been really hermetically sealed i fancied at first that it was paraffin wax and smashed the glass accordingly but the odour of camphor was unmistakable in the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive perhaps through many thousands of centuries it reminded me of a sepia painting i had once seen done from the ink of a fossil belemnite that must have perished and become fossilised millions of years ago i was about to throw it away but i remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame—was in fact an excellent candle—and i put it in my pocket i found no explosives however nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors as yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing i had chanced upon nevertheless i left that gallery greatly elated “i cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon it would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order i remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms and how i hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword i could not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates there were numbers of guns pistols and rifles the most were masses of rust but many were of some new metal and still fairly sound but any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust one corner i saw was charred and shattered perhaps i thought by an explosion among the specimens in another place was a vast array of idols—polynesian mexican grecian phœnician every country on earth i should think and here yielding to an irresistible impulse i wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from south america that particularly took my fancy “as the evening drew on my interest waned i went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite sometimes fresher in one place i suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by the merest accident i discovered in an airtight case two dynamite cartridges i shouted ‘eureka’ and smashed the case with joy then came a doubt i hesitated then selecting a little side gallery i made my essay i never felt such a disappointment as i did in waiting five ten fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came of course the things were dummies as i might have guessed from their presence i really believe that had they not been so i should have rushed off incontinently and blown sphinx bronze doors and as it proved my chances of finding the time machine all together into nonexistence “it was after that i think that we came to a little open court within the palace it was turfed and had three fruittrees so we rested and refreshed ourselves towards sunset i began to consider our position night was creeping upon us and my inaccessible hidingplace had still to be found but that troubled me very little now i had in my possession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defences against the morlocks—i had matches i had the camphor in my pocket too if a blaze were needed it seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open protected by a fire in the morning there was the getting of the time machine towards that as yet i had only my iron mace but now with my growing knowledge i felt very differently towards those bronze doors up to this i had refrained from forcing them largely because of the mystery on the other side they had never impressed me as being very strong and i hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work xii in the darkness “we emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon i was determined to reach the white sphinx early the next morning and ere the dusk i purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey my plan was to go as far as possible that night and then building a fire to sleep in the protection of its glare accordingly as we went along i gathered any sticks or dried grass i saw and presently had my arms full of such litter thus loaded our progress was slower than i had anticipated and besides weena was tired and i also began to suffer from sleepiness too so that it was full night before we reached the wood upon the shrubby hill of its edge weena would have stopped fearing the darkness before us but a singular sense of impending calamity that should indeed have served me as a warning drove me onward i had been without sleep for a night and two days and i was feverish and irritable i felt sleep coming upon me and the morlocks with it “while we hesitated among the black bushes behind us and dim against their blackness i saw three crouching figures there was scrub and long grass all about us and i did not feel safe from their insidious approach the forest i calculated was rather less than a mile across if we could get through it to the bare hillside there as it seemed to me was an altogether safer restingplace i thought that with my matches and my camphor i could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods yet it was evident that if i was to flourish matches with my hands i should have to abandon my firewood so rather reluctantly i put it down and then it came into my head that i would amaze our friends behind by lighting it i was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat “i don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate the sun’s heat is rarely strong enough to burn even when it is focused by dewdrops as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts lightning may blast and blacken but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation but this rarely results in flame in this decadence too the art of firemaking had been forgotten on the earth the red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to weena “she wanted to run to it and play with it i believe she would have cast herself into it had i not restrained her but i caught her up and in spite of her struggles plunged boldly before me into the wood for a little way the glare of my fire lit the path looking back presently i could see through the crowded stems that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill i laughed at that and turned again to the dark trees before me it was very black and weena clung to me convulsively but there was still as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness sufficient light for me to avoid the stems overhead it was simply black except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there i lit none of my matches because i had no hand free upon my left arm i carried my little one in my right hand i had my iron bar “for some way i heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet the faint rustle of the breeze above and my own breathing and the throb of the bloodvessels in my ears then i seemed to know of a pattering behind me i pushed on grimly the pattering grew more distinct and then i caught the same queer sound and voices i had heard in the underworld there were evidently several of the morlocks and they were closing in upon me indeed in another minute i felt a tug at my coat then something at my arm and weena shivered violently and became quite still “it was time for a match but to get one i must put her down i did so and as i fumbled with my pocket a struggle began in the darkness about my knees perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the morlocks soft little hands too were creeping over my coat and back touching even my neck then the match scratched and fizzed i held it flaring and saw the white backs of the morlocks in flight amid the trees i hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane then i looked at weena she was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless with her face to the ground with a sudden fright i stooped to her she seemed scarcely to breathe i lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground and as it split and flared up and drove back the morlocks and the shadows i knelt down and lifted her the wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company “she seemed to have fainted i put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on and then there came a horrible realisation in manœuvring with my matches and weena i had turned myself about several times and now i had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path for all i knew i might be facing back towards the palace of green porcelain i found myself in a cold sweat i had to think rapidly what to do i determined to build a fire and encamp where we were i put weena still motionless down upon a turfy bole and very hastily as my first lump of camphor waned i began collecting sticks and leaves here and there out of the darkness round me the morlocks’ eyes shone like carbuncles “the camphor flickered and went out i lit a match and as i did so two white forms that had been approaching weena dashed hastily away one was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and i felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist he gave a whoop of dismay staggered a little way and fell down i lit another piece of camphor and went on gathering my bonfire presently i noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the time machine a matter of a week no rain had fallen so instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs i began leaping up and dragging down branches very soon i had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks and could economise my camphor then i turned to where weena lay beside my iron mace i tried what i could to revive her but she lay like one dead i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed “now the smoke of the fire beat over towards me and it must have made me heavy of a sudden moreover the vapour of camphor was in the air my fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so i felt very weary after my exertion and sat down the wood too was full of a slumbrous murmur that i did not understand i seemed just to nod and open my eyes but all was dark and the morlocks had their hands upon me flinging off their clinging fingers i hastily felt in my pocket for the matchbox and—it had gone then they gripped and closed with me again in a moment i knew what had happened i had slept and my fire had gone out and the bitterness of death came over my soul the forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood i was caught by the neck by the hair by the arms and pulled down it was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me i felt as if i was in a monstrous spider’s web i was overpowered and went down i felt little teeth nipping at my neck i rolled over and as i did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i struggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be i could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows and for a moment i was free “the strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me i knew that both i and weena were lost but i determined to make the morlocks pay for their meat i stood with my back to a tree swinging the iron bar before me the whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them a minute passed their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement and their movements grew faster yet none came within reach i stood glaring at the blackness then suddenly came hope what if the morlocks were afraid and close on the heels of that came a strange thing the darkness seemed to grow luminous very dimly i began to see the morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then i recognised with incredulous surprise that the others were running in an incessant stream as it seemed from behind me and away through the wood in front and their backs seemed no longer white but reddish as i stood agape i saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches and vanish and at that i understood the smell of burning wood the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar the red glow and the morlocks’ flight “stepping out from behind my tree and looking back i saw through the black pillars of the nearer trees the flames of the burning forest it was my first fire coming after me with that i looked for weena but she was gone the hissing and crackling behind me the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflection my iron bar still gripped i followed in the morlocks’ path it was a close race once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as i ran that i was outflanked and had to strike off to the left but at last i emerged upon a small open space and as i did so a morlock came blundering towards me and past me and went on straight into the fire “and now i was to see the most weird and horrible thing i think of all that i beheld in that future age this whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire in the centre was a hillock or tumulus surmounted by a scorched hawthorn beyond this was another arm of the burning forest with yellow tongues already writhing from it completely encircling the space with a fence of fire upon the hillside were some thirty or forty morlocks dazzled by the light and heat and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment at first i did not realise their blindness and struck furiously at them with my bar in a frenzy of fear as they approached me killing one and crippling several more but when i had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky and heard their moans i was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare and i struck no more of them “yet every now and then one would come straight towards me setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him at one time the flames died down somewhat and i feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me i was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen but the fire burst out again brightly and i stayed my hand i walked about the hill among them and avoided them looking for some trace of weena but weena was gone “at last i sat down on the summit of the hillock and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro and making uncanny noises to each other as the glare of the fire beat on them the coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky and through the rare tatters of that red canopy remote as though they belonged to another universe shone the little stars two or three morlocks came blundering into me and i drove them off with blows of my fists trembling as i did so “for the most part of that night i was persuaded it was a nightmare i bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake i beat the ground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered here and there and again sat down then i would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon god to let me awake thrice i saw morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames but at last above the subsiding red of the fire above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures came the white light of the day “i searched again for traces of weena but there were none it was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest i cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined as i thought of that i was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me but i contained myself the hillock as i have said was a kind of island in the forest from its summit i could now make out through a haze of smoke the palace of green porcelain and from that i could get my bearings for the white sphinx and so leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning as the day grew clearer i tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire towards the hidingplace of the time machine i walked slowly for i was almost exhausted as well as lame and i felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little weena it seemed an overwhelming calamity now in this old familiar room it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss but that morning it left me absolutely lonely again—terribly alone i began to think of this house of mine of this fireside of some of you and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain “but as i walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky i made a discovery in my trouser pocket were still some loose matches the box must have leaked before it was lost xiii the trap of the white sphinx “about eight or nine in the morning i came to the same seat of yellow metal from which i had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival i thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence here was the same beautiful scene the same abundant foliage the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins the same silver river running between its fertile banks the gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees some were bathing in exactly the place where i had saved weena and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain and like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the underworld i understood now what all the beauty of the overworld people covered very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field like the cattle they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs and their end was the same “i grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been it had committed suicide it had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last once life and property must have reached almost absolute safety the rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort the toiler assured of his life and work no doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem no social question left unsolved and a great quiet had followed “it is a law of nature we overlook that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change danger and trouble an animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless there is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers “so as i see it the upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness and the underworld to mere mechanical industry but that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection—absolute permanency apparently as time went on the feeding of an underworld however it was effected had become disjointed mother necessity who had been staved off for a few thousand years came back again and she began below the underworld being in contact with machinery which however perfect still needs some little thought outside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiative if less of every other human character than the upper and when other meat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden so i say i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one it may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent it is how the thing shaped itself to me and as that i give it to you “after the fatigues excitements and terrors of the past days and in spite of my grief this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant i was very tired and sleepy and soon my theorising passed into dozing catching myself at that i took my own hint and spreading myself out upon the turf i had a long and refreshing sleep “i awoke a little before sunsetting i now felt safe against being caught napping by the morlocks and stretching myself i came on down the hill towards the white sphinx i had my crowbar in one hand and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket “and now came a most unexpected thing as i approached the pedestal of the sphinx i found the bronze valves were open they had slid down into grooves “at that i stopped short before them hesitating to enter “within was a small apartment and on a raised place in the corner of this was the time machine i had the small levers in my pocket so here after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the white sphinx was a meek surrender i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not to use it “a sudden thought came into my head as i stooped towards the portal for once at least i grasped the mental operations of the morlocks suppressing a strong inclination to laugh i stepped through the bronze frame and up to the time machine i was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned i have suspected since that the morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose “now as i stood and examined it finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance the thing i had expected happened the bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang i was in the dark—trapped so the morlocks thought at that i chuckled gleefully “i could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me very calmly i tried to strike the match i had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost but i had overlooked one little thing the matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box “you may imagine how all my calm vanished the little brutes were close upon me one touched me i made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine then came one hand upon me and then another then i had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted one indeed they almost got away from me as it slipped from my hand i had to butt in the dark with my head—i could hear the morlock’s skull ring—to recover it it was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest i think this last scramble “but at last the lever was fixed and pulled over the clinging hands slipped from me the darkness presently fell from my eyes i found myself in the same grey light and tumult i have already described xiv the further vision “i have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling and this time i was not seated properly in the saddle but sideways and in an unstable fashion for an indefinite time i clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated quite unheeding how i went and when i brought myself to look at the dials again i was amazed to find where i had arrived one dial records days and another thousands of days another millions of days and another thousands of millions now instead of reversing the levers i had pulled them over so as to go forward with them and when i came to look at these indicators i found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch—into futurity “as i drove on a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things the palpitating greyness grew darker then—though i was still travelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and night which was usually indicative of a slower pace returned and grew more and more marked this puzzled me very much at first the alternations of night and day grew slower and slower and so did the passage of the sun across the sky until they seemed to stretch through centuries at last a steady twilight brooded over the earth a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky the band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in the west and grew ever broader and more red all trace of the moon had vanished the circling of the stars growing slower and slower had given place to creeping points of light at last some time before i stopped the sun red and very large halted motionless upon the horizon a vast dome glowing with a dull heat and now and then suffering a momentary extinction at one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat i perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done the earth had come to rest with one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces the earth very cautiously for i remembered my former headlong fall i began to reverse my motion slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale still slower until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible “i stopped very gently and sat upon the time machine looking round the sky was no longer blue northeastward it was inky black and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars overhead it was a deep indian red and starless and southeastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where cut by the horizon lay the huge hull of the sun red and motionless the rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that i could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their southeastern face it was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight “the machine was standing on a sloping beach the sea stretched away to the southwest to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky there were no breakers and no waves for not a breath of wind was stirring only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living and along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky there was a sense of oppression in my head and i noticed that i was breathing very fast the sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering and from that i judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now “far away up the desolate slope i heard a harsh scream and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond the sound of its voice was so dismal that i shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine looking round me again i saw that quite near what i had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me then i saw the thing was really a monstrous crablike creature can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly its big claws swaying its long antennæ like carters’ whips waving and feeling and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there i could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved “as i stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me i felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there i tried to brush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almost immediately came another by my ear i struck at this and caught something threadlike it was drawn swiftly out of my hand with a frightful qualm i turned and i saw that i had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks its mouth was all alive with appetite and its vast ungainly claws smeared with an algal slime were descending upon me in a moment my hand was on the lever and i had placed a month between myself and these monsters but i was still on the same beach and i saw them distinctly now as soon as i stopped dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there in the sombre light among the foliated sheets of intense green “i cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world the red eastern sky the northward blackness the salt dead sea the stony beach crawling with these foul slowstirring monsters the uniform poisonouslooking green of the lichenous plants the thin air that hurts one’s lungs all contributed to an appalling effect i moved on a hundred years and there was the same red sun—a little larger a little duller—the same dying sea the same chill air and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks and in the westward sky i saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon “so i travelled stopping ever and again in great strides of a thousand years or more drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million years hence the huge redhot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens then i stopped once more for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared and the red beach save for its livid green liverworts and lichens seemed lifeless and now it was flecked with white a bitter cold assailed me rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down to the northeastward the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and i could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white there were fringes of ice along the sea margin with drifting masses farther out but the main expanse of that salt ocean all bloody under the eternal sunset was still unfrozen “i looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained a certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine but i saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea the green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct a shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach i fancied i saw some black object flopping about upon this bank but it became motionless as i looked at it and i judged that my eye had been deceived and that the black object was merely a rock the stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little “suddenly i noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed that a concavity a bay had appeared in the curve i saw this grow larger for a minute perhaps i stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day and then i realised that an eclipse was beginning either the moon or the planet mercury was passing across the sun’s disk naturally at first i took it to be the moon but there is much to incline me to believe that what i really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth “the darkness grew apace a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number from the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent silent it would be hard to convey the stillness of it all the sounds of man the bleating of sheep the cries of birds the hum of insects the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over as the darkness thickened the eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes and the cold of the air more intense at last one by one swiftly one after the other the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness the breeze rose to a moaning wind i saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me in another moment the pale stars alone were visible all else was rayless obscurity the sky was absolutely black “a horror of this great darkness came on me the cold that smote to my marrow and the pain i felt in breathing overcame me i shivered and a deadly nausea seized me then like a redhot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun i got off the machine to recover myself i felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey as i stood sick and confused i saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the sea it was a round thing the size of a football perhaps or it may be bigger and tentacles trailed down from it it seemed black against the weltering bloodred water and it was hopping fitfully about then i felt i was fainting but a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while i clambered upon the saddle xv the time traveller’s return “so i came back for a long time i must have been insensible upon the machine the blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed the sun got golden again the sky blue i breathed with greater freedom the fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed the hands spun backward upon the dials at last i saw again the dim shadows of houses the evidences of decadent humanity these too changed and passed and others came presently when the million dial was at zero i slackened speed i began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture the thousands hand ran back to the startingpoint the night and day flapped slower and slower then the old walls of the laboratory came round me very gently now i slowed the mechanism down “i saw one little thing that seemed odd to me i think i have told you that when i set out before my velocity became very high mrs watchett had walked across the room travelling as it seemed to me like a rocket as i returned i passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory but now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones the door at the lower end opened and she glided quietly up the laboratory back foremost and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered just before that i seemed to see hillyer for a moment but he passed like a flash “then i stopped the machine and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory my tools my appliances just as i had left them i got off the thing very shakily and sat down upon my bench for several minutes i trembled violently then i became calmer around me was my old workshop again exactly as it had been i might have slept there and the whole thing have been a dream “and yet not exactly the thing had started from the southeast corner of the laboratory it had come to rest again in the northwest against the wall where you saw it that gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the white sphinx into which the morlocks had carried my machine “for a time my brain went stagnant presently i got up and came through the passage here limping because my heel was still painful and feeling sorely begrimed i saw the pall mall gazette on the table by the door i found the date was indeed today and looking at the timepiece saw the hour was almost eight o’clock i heard your voices and the clatter of plates i hesitated—i felt so sick and weak then i sniffed good wholesome meat and opened the door on you you know the rest i washed and dined and now i am telling you the story xvi after the story “i know” he said after a pause “that all this will be absolutely incredible to you but to me the one incredible thing is that i am here tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures” he looked at the medical man “no i cannot expect you to believe it take it as a lie—or a prophecy say i dreamed it in the workshop consider i have been speculating upon the destinies of our race until i have hatched this fiction treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest and taking it as a story what do you think of it” he took up his pipe and began in his old accustomed manner to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate there was a momentary stillness then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet i took my eyes off the time traveller’s face and looked round at his audience they were in the dark and little spots of colour swam before them the medical man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host the editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the sixth the journalist fumbled for his watch the others as far as i remember were motionless the editor stood up with a sigh “what a pity it is you’re not a writer of stories” he said putting his hand on the time traveller’s shoulder “you don’t believe it” “well——” “i thought not” the time traveller turned to us “where are the matches” he said he lit one and spoke over his pipe puffing “to tell you the truth i hardly believe it myself and yet” his eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table then he turned over the hand holding his pipe and i saw he was looking at some halfhealed scars on his knuckles the medical man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers “the gynæceum’s odd” he said the psychologist leant forward to see holding out his hand for a specimen “i’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one” said the journalist “how shall we get home” “plenty of cabs at the station” said the psychologist “it’s a curious thing” said the medical man “but i certainly don’t know the natural order of these flowers may i have them” the time traveller hesitated then suddenly “certainly not” “where did you really get them” said the medical man the time traveller put his hand to his head he spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him “they were put into my pocket by weena when i travelled into time” he stared round the room “i’m damned if it isn’t all going this room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory did i ever make a time machine or a model of a time machine or is it all only a dream they say life is a dream a precious poor dream at times—but i can’t stand another that won’t fit it’s madness and where did the dream come from … i must look at that machine if there is one” he caught up the lamp swiftly and carried it flaring red through the door into the corridor we followed him there in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough squat ugly and askew a thing of brass ebony ivory and translucent glimmering quartz solid to the touch—for i put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts and one rail bent awry the time traveller put the lamp down on the bench and ran his hand along the damaged rail “it’s all right now” he said “the story i told you was true i’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold” he took up the lamp and in an absolute silence we returned to the smokingroom he came into the hall with us and helped the editor on with his coat the medical man looked into his face and with a certain hesitation told him he was suffering from overwork at which he laughed hugely i remember him standing in the open doorway bawling goodnight i shared a cab with the editor he thought the tale a “gaudy lie” for my own part i was unable to come to a conclusion the story was so fantastic and incredible the telling so credible and sober i lay awake most of the night thinking about it i determined to go next day and see the time traveller again i was told he was in the laboratory and being on easy terms in the house i went up to him the laboratory however was empty i stared for a minute at the time machine and put out my hand and touched the lever at that the squat substantiallooking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind its instability startled me extremely and i had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when i used to be forbidden to meddle i came back through the corridor the time traveller met me in the smokingroom he was coming from the house he had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other he laughed when he saw me and gave me an elbow to shake “i’m frightfully busy” said he “with that thing in there” “but is it not some hoax” i said “do you really travel through time” “really and truly i do” and he looked frankly into my eyes he hesitated his eye wandered about the room “i only want half an hour” he said “i know why you came and it’s awfully good of you there’s some magazines here if you’ll stop to lunch i’ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt specimens and all if you’ll forgive my leaving you now” i consented hardly comprehending then the full import of his words and he nodded and went on down the corridor i heard the door of the laboratory slam seated myself in a chair and took up a daily paper what was he going to do before lunchtime then suddenly i was reminded by an advertisement that i had promised to meet richardson the publisher at two i looked at my watch and saw that i could barely save that engagement i got up and went down the passage to tell the time traveller as i took hold of the handle of the door i heard an exclamation oddly truncated at the end and a click and a thud a gust of air whirled round me as i opened the door and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor the time traveller was not there i seemed to see a ghostly indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct but this phantasm vanished as i rubbed my eyes the time machine had gone save for a subsiding stir of dust the further end of the laboratory was empty a pane of the skylight had apparently just been blown in i felt an unreasonable amazement i knew that something strange had happened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be as i stood staring the door into the garden opened and the manservant appeared we looked at each other then ideas began to come “has mr —— gone out that way” said i “no sir no one has come out this way i was expecting to find him here” at that i understood at the risk of disappointing richardson i stayed on waiting for the time traveller waiting for the second perhaps still stranger story and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him but i am beginning now to fear that i must wait a lifetime the time traveller vanished three years ago and as everybody knows now he has never returned epilogue one cannot choose but wonder will he ever return it may be that he swept back into the past and fell among the blooddrinking hairy savages of the age of unpolished stone into the abysses of the cretaceous sea or among the grotesque saurians the huge reptilian brutes of the jurassic times he may even now—if i may use the phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurushaunted oolitic coral reef or beside the lonely saline seas of the triassic age or did he go forward into one of the nearer ages in which men are still men but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved into the manhood of the race for i for my own part cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment fragmentary theory and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time i say for my own part he i know—for the question had been discussed among us long before the time machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the advancement of mankind and saw in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end if that is so it remains for us to live as though it were not so but to me the future is still black and blank—is a vast ignorance lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story and i have by me for my comfort two strange white flowers—shrivelled now and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that even when mind and strength had gone gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man end of the project gutenberg ebook the time

chapter 1 my uncle makes a great discovery looking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day i am scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures they were truly so wonderful that even now i am bewildered when i think of them my uncle was a german having married my mothers sister an englishwoman being very much attached to his fatherless nephew he invited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland this home was in a large town and my uncle a professor of philosophy chemistry geology mineralogy and many other ologies one day after passing some hours in the laboratorymy uncle being absent at the timei suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the tissuesiiei i was hungry and was about to rouse up our old french cook when my uncle professor von hardwigg suddenly opened the street door and came rushing upstairs now professor hardwigg my worthy uncle is by no means a bad sort of man he is however choleric and original to bear with him means to obey and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint domicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him harryharryharry i hastened to obey but before i could reach his room jumping three steps at a time he was stamping his right foot upon the landing harry he cried in a frantic tone are you coming up now to tell the truth at that moment i was far more interested in the question as to what was to constitute our dinner than in any problem of science to me soup was more interesting than soda an omelette more tempting than arithmetic and an artichoke of ten times more value than any amount of asbestos but my uncle was not a man to be kept waiting so adjourning therefore all minor questions i presented myself before him he was a very learned man now most persons in this category supply themselves with information as peddlers do with goods for the benefit of others and lay up stores in order to diffuse them abroad for the benefit of society in general not so my excellent uncle professor hardwigg he studied he consumed the midnight oil he pored over heavy tomes and digested huge quartos and folios in order to keep the knowledge acquired to himself there was a reason and it may be regarded as a good one why my uncle objected to display his learning more than was absolutely necessary he stammered and when intent upon explaining the phenomena of the heavens was apt to find himself at fault and allude in such a vague way to sun moon and stars that few were able to comprehend his meaning to tell the honest truth when the right word would not come it was generally replaced by a very powerful adjective in connection with the sciences there are many almost unpronounceable namesnames very much resembling those of welsh villages and my uncle being very fond of using them his habit of stammering was not thereby improved in fact there were periods in his discourse when he would finally give up and swallow his discomfiturein a glass of water as i said my uncle professor hardwigg was a very learned man and i now add a most kind relative i was bound to him by the double ties of affection and interest i took deep interest in all his doings and hoped some day to be almost as learned myself it was a rare thing for me to be absent from his lectures like him i preferred mineralogy to all the other sciences my anxiety was to gain real iknowledge of the earthi geology and mineralogy were to us the sole objects of life and in connection with these studies many a fair specimen of stone chalk or metal did we break with our hammers steel rods loadstones glass pipes and bottles of various acids were oftener before us than our meals my uncle hardwigg was once known to classify six hundred different geological specimens by their weight hardness fusibility sound taste and smell he corresponded with all the great learned and scientific men of the age i was therefore in constant communication with at all events the letters of sir humphry davy captain franklin and other great men but before i state the subject on which my uncle wished to confer with me i must say a word about his personal appearance alas my readers will see a very different portrait of him at a future time after he has gone through the fearful adventures yet to be related my uncle was fifty years old tall thin and wiry large spectacles hid to a certain extent his vast round and goggle eyes while his nose was irreverently compared to a thin file so much indeed did it resemble that useful article that a compass was said in his presence to have made considerable n nasal deviation the truth being told however the only article really attracted to my uncles nose was tobacco another peculiarity of his was that he always stepped a yard at a time clenched his fists as if he were going to hit you and was when in one of his peculiar humors very far from a pleasant companion it is further necessary to observe that he lived in a very nice house in that very nice street the konigstrasse at hamburg though lying in the centre of a town it was perfectly rural in its aspecthalf wood half bricks with oldfashioned gablesone of the few old houses spared by the great fire of 1842 when i say a nice house i mean a handsome houseold tottering and not exactly comfortable to english notions a house a little off the perpendicular and inclined to fall into the neighboring canal exactly the house for a wandering artist to depict all the more that you could scarcely see it for ivy and a magnificent old tree which grew over the door my uncle was rich his house was his own property while he had a considerable private income to my notion the best part of his possessions was his goddaughter gretchen and the old cook the young lady the professor and i were the sole inhabitants i loved mineralogy i loved geology to me there was nothing like pebblesand if my uncle had been in a little less of a fury we should have been the happiest of families to prove the excellent hardwiggs impatience i solemnly declare that when the flowers in the drawingroom pots began to grow he rose every morning at four oclock to make them grow quicker by pulling the leaves having described my uncle i will now give an account of our interview he received me in his study a perfect museum containing every natural curiosity that can well be imaginedminerals however predominating every one was familiar to me having been catalogued by my own hand my uncle apparently oblivious of the fact that he had summoned me to his presence was absorbed in a book he was particularly fond of early editions tall copies and unique works wonderful he cried tapping his forehead wonderfulwonderful it was one of those yellowleaved volumes now rarely found on stalls and to me it appeared to possess but little value my uncle however was in raptures he admired its binding the clearness of its characters the ease with which it opened in his hand and repeated aloud half a dozen times that it was very very old to my fancy he was making a great fuss about nothing but it was not my province to say so on the contrary i professed considerable interest in the subject and asked him what it was about it is the heimskringla of snorre tarleson he said the celebrated icelandic author of the twelfth centuryit is a true and correct account of the norwegian princes who reigned in iceland my next question related to the language in which it was written i hoped at all events it was translated into german my uncle was indignant at the very thought and declared he wouldnt give a penny for a translation his delight was to have found the original work in the icelandic tongue which he declared to be one of the most magnificent and yet simple idioms in the worldwhile at the same time its grammatical combinations were the most varied known to students about as easy as german was my insidious remark my uncle shrugged his shoulders the letters at all events i said are rather difficult of comprehension it is a runic manuscript the language of the original population of iceland invented by odin himself cried my uncle angry at my ignorance i was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject when a small scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves like a hungry man snatching at a morsel of bread the professor seized it it was about five inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary fashion the lines shown here are an exact facsimile of what was written on the venerable piece of parchmentand have wonderful importance as they induced my uncle to undertake the most wonderful series of adventures which ever fell to the lot of human beings my uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then declared that it was runic the letters were similar to those in the book but then what did they mean this was exactly what i wanted to know now as i had a strong conviction that the runic alphabet and dialect were simply an invention to mystify poor human nature i was delighted to find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as i didwhich was nothing at all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think so and yet he muttered to himself it is old icelandic i am sure of it and my uncle ought to have known for he was a perfect polyglot dictionary in himself he did not pretend like a certain learned pundit to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms made use of in different parts of the globe but he did know all the more important ones it is a matter of great doubt to me now to what violent measures my uncles impetuosity might have led him had not the clock struck two and our old french cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the table bother the dinner cried my uncle but as i was hungry i sallied forth to the dining room where i took up my usual quarters out of politeness i waited three minutes but no sign of my uncle the professor i was surprised he was not usually so blind to the pleasure of a good dinner it was the acme of german luxuryparsley soup a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings an oyster of veal stewed with prunes delicious fruit and sparkling moselle for the sake of poring over this musty old piece of parchment my uncle forbore to share our meal to satisfy my conscience i ate for both the old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind after taking so much trouble to find her master not appear at dinner was to her a sad disappointmentwhich as she occasionally watched the havoc i was making on the viands became also alarm if my uncle were to come to table after all suddenly just as i had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass of wine a terrible voice was heard at no great distance it was my uncle roaring for me to come to him i made very nearly one leap of itso loud so fierce was his tone chapter 2 the mysterious parchment illustration runic glyphs i declare cried my uncle striking the table fiercely with his fist i declare to you it is runicand contains some wonderful secret which i must get at at any price i was about to reply when he stopped me sit down he said quite fiercely and write to my dictation i obeyed i will substitute he said a letter of our alphabet for that of the runic we will then see what that will produce now begin and make no mistakes the dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result mmrnlls esruel seecjde sgtssmf unteief niedrke ktsamn atrates saodrrn emtnaei nuaect rrilsa atvaar nscrc ieaabs ccdrmi eeutul frantu dtiac oseibo kediiy scarcely giving me time to finish my uncle snatched the document from my hands and examined it with the most rapt and deep attention i should like to know what it means he said after a long period i certainly could not tell him nor did he expect me tohis conversation being uniformly answered by himself i declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph he cried unless indeed the letters have been written without any real meaning and yet why take so much trouble who knows but i may be on the verge of some great discovery my candid opinion was that it was all rubbish but this opinion i kept carefully to myself as my uncles choler was not pleasant to bear all this time he was comparing the book with the parchment the manuscript volume and the smaller document are written in different hands he said the cryptograph is of much later date than the book there is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise an irrefragable proof i took it to be the first letter is a double m which was only added to the icelandic language in the twelfth centurythis makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the volume the circumstances appeared very probable and very logical but it was all surmise to me to me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner of the book now who was the owner is the next important question perhaps by great good luck it may be written somewhere in the volume with these words professor hardwigg took off his spectacles and taking a powerful magnifying glass examined the book carefully on the fly leaf was what appeared to be a blot of ink but on examination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time this was what he sought and after some considerable time he made out these letters illustration runic glyphs arne saknussemm he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone that is not only an icelandic name but of a learned professor of the sixteenth century a celebrated alchemist i bowed as a sign of respect these alchemists he continued avicenna bacon lully paracelsus were the true the only learned men of the day they made surprising discoveries may not this saknussemm nephew mine have hidden on this bit of parchment some astounding invention i believe the cryptograph to have a profound meaningwhich i must make out my uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost impossible to describe it may be so sir i timidly observed but why conceal it from posterity if it be a useful a worthy discovery whyhow should i know did not galileo make a secret of his discoveries in connection with saturn but we shall see until i discover the meaning of this sentence i will neither eat nor sleep my dear uncle i began nor you neither he added it was lucky i had taken double allowance that day in the first place he continued there must be a clue to the meaning if we could find that the rest would be easy enough i began seriously to reflect the prospect of going without food and sleep was not a promising one so i determined to do my best to solve the mystery my uncle meanwhile went on with his soliloquy the way to discover it is easy enough in this document there are one hundred and thirtytwo letters giving seventynine consonants to fiftythree vowels this is about the proportion found in most southern languages the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants we may confidently predict therefore that we have to deal with a southern dialect nothing could be more logical now said professor hardwigg to trace the particular language as shakespeare says that is the question was my rather satirical reply this man saknussemm he continued was a very learned man now as he did not write in the language of his birthplace he probably like most learned men of the sixteenth century wrote in latin if however i prove wrong in this guess we must try spanish french italian greek and even hebrew my own opinion though is decidedly in favor of latin this proposition startled me latin was my favorite study and it seemed sacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of virgil barbarous latin in all probability continued my uncle but still latin very probably i replied not to contradict him let us see into the matter continued my uncle here you see we have a series of one hundred and thirtytwo letters apparently thrown pellmell upon paper without method or organization there are words which are composed wholly of consonants such as immrnllsi others which are nearly all vowels the fifth for instance which is unteief and one of the last oseibo this appears an extraordinary combination probably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some mathematical plan no doubt a certain sentence has been written out and then jumbled upsome plan to which some figure is the clue now harry to show your english witwhat is that figure i could give him no hint my thoughts were indeed far away while he was speaking i had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin gretchen and was wondering when she would return we were affianced and loved one another very sincerely but my uncle who never thought even of such sublunary matters knew nothing of this without noticing my abstraction the professor began reading the puzzling cryptograph all sorts of ways according to some theory of his own presently rousing my wandering attention he dictated one precious attempt to me i mildly handed it over to him it read as follows immessunkasenraicefdoksegnittamurtn ecertserretterotaivsaduaednecsedsadne lacartniiilrjsiratracsarbmutabiledmek meretarcsilucoysleffensnii i could scarcely keep from laughing while my uncle on the contrary got in a towering passion struck the table with his fist darted out of the room out of the house and then taking to his heels was presently lost to sight chapter 3 an astounding discovery what is the matter cried the cook entering the room when will master have his dinner never and his supper i dont know he says he will eat no more neither shall i my uncle has determined to fast and make me fast until he makes out this abominable inscription i replied you will be starved to death she said i was very much of the same opinion but not liking to say so sent her away and began some of my usual work of classification but try as i might nothing could keep me from thinking alternately of the stupid manuscript and of the pretty gretchen several times i thought of going out but my uncle would have been angry at my absence at the end of an hour my allotted task was done how to pass the time i began by lighting my pipe like all other students i delighted in tobacco and seating myself in the great armchair i began to think where was my uncle i could easily imagine him tearing along some solitary road gesticulating talking to himself cutting the air with his cane and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics would he hit upon some clue would he come home in better humor while these thoughts were passing through my brain i mechanically took up the execrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters i put them together by twos by threes fours and fivesin vain nothing intelligible came out except that the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth made iicei in english the eightyfourth eightyfifth and eightysixth the word isiri then at last i seemed to find the latin words irota mutabile ira nec atrai ha there seems to be some truth in my uncles notion thought i then again i seemed to find the word ilucoi which means sacred wood then in the third line i appeared to make out ilabiledi a perfect hebrew word and at the last the syllables mere are mer which were french it was enough to drive one mad four different idioms in this absurd phrase what connection could there be between ice sir anger cruel sacred wood changing mother are and sea the first and the last might in a sentence connected with iceland mean sea of ice but what of the rest of this monstrous cryptograph i was in fact fighting against an insurmountable difficulty my brain was almost on fire my eyes were strained with staring at the parchment the whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my vision in a number of black little groups my mind was possessed with temporary hallucinationi was stifling i wanted air mechanically i fanned myself with the document of which now i saw the back and then the front imagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle the ink having gone through i clearly made out latin words and among others craterem and terrestre i had discovered the secret it came upon me like a flash of lightning i had got the clue all you had to do to understand the document was to read it backwards all the ingenious ideas of the professor were realized he had dictated it rightly to me by a mere accident i had discovered what he so much desired my delight my emotion may be imagined my eyes were dazzled and i trembled so that at first i could make nothing of it one look however would tell me all i wished to know let me read i said to myself after drawing a long breath i spread it before me on the table i passed my finger over each letter i spelled it through in my excitement i read it out what horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul i was like a man who had received a knockdown blow was it possible that i really read the terrible secret and it had really been accomplished a man had dared to dowhat no living being should ever know never cried i jumping up never shall my uncle be made aware of the dread secret he would be quite capable of undertaking the terrible journey nothing would check him nothing stop him worse he would compel me to accompany him and we should be lost forever but no such folly and madness cannot be allowed i was almost beside myself with rage and fury my worthy uncle is already nearly mad i cried aloud this would finish him by some accident he may make the discovery in which case we are both lost perish the fearful secretlet the flames forever bury it in oblivion i snatched up book and parchment and was about to cast them into the fire when the door opened and my uncle entered i had scarcely time to put down the wretched documents before my uncle was by my side he was profoundly absorbed his thoughts were evidently bent on the terrible parchment some new combination had probably struck him while taking his walk he seated himself in his armchair and with a pen began to make an algebraical calculation i watched him with anxious eyes my flesh crawled as it became probable that he would discover the secret his combinations i knew now were useless i having discovered the one only clue for three mortal hours he continued without speaking a word without raising his head scratching rewriting calculating over and over again i knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase the letters of every alphabet have only a certain number of combinations but then years might elapse before he would arrive at the correct solution still time went on night came the sounds in the streets ceasedand still my uncle went on not even answering our worthy cook when she called us to supper i did not dare to leave him so waved her away and at last fell asleep on the sofa when i awoke my uncle was still at work his red eyes his pallid countenance his matted hair his feverish hands his hectically flushed cheeks showed how terrible had been his struggle with the impossible and what fearful fatigue he had undergone during that long sleepless night it made me quite ill to look at him though he was rather severe with me i loved him and my heart ached at his sufferings he was so overcome by one idea that he could not even get in a passion all his energies were focused on one point and i knew that by speaking one little word all this suffering would cease i could not speak it my heart was nevertheless inclining towards him why then did i remain silent in the interest of my uncle himself nothing shall make me speak i muttered he will want to follow in the footsteps of the other i know him well his imagination is a perfect volcano and to make discoveries in the interests of geology he would sacrifice his life i will therefore be silent and strictly keep the secret i have discovered to reveal it would be suicidal he would not only rush himself to destruction but drag me with him i crossed my arms looked another way and smokedresolved never to speak when our cook wanted to go out to market or on any other errand she found the front door locked and the key taken away was this done purposely or not surely professor hardwigg did not intend the old woman and myself to become martyrs to his obstinate will were we to be starved to death a frightful recollection came to my mind once we had fed on bits and scraps for a week while he sorted some curiosities it gave me the cramp even to think of it i wanted my breakfast and i saw no way of getting it still my resolution held good i would starve rather than yield but the cook began to take me seriously to task what was to be done she could not go out and i dared not my uncle continued counting and writing his imagination seemed to have translated him to the skies he neither thought of eating nor drinking in this way twelve oclock came round i was hungry and there was nothing in the house the cook had eaten the last bit of bread this could not go on it did however until two when my sensations were terrible after all i began to think the document very absurd perhaps it might only be a gigantic hoax besides some means would surely be found to keep my uncle back from attempting any such absurd expedition on the other hand if he did attempt anything so quixotic i should not be compelled to accompany him another line of reasoning partially decided me very likely he would make the discovery himself when i should have suffered starvation for nothing under the influence of hunger this reasoning appeared admirable i determined to tell all the question now arose as to how it was to be done i was still dwelling on the thought when he rose and put on his hat what go out and lock us in never uncle i began he did not appear even to hear me professor hardwigg i cried what he retorted did you speak how about the key what keythe key of the door noof these horrible hieroglyphics he looked at me from under his spectacles and started at the odd expression of my face rushing forward he clutched me by the arm and keenly examined my countenance his very look was an interrogation i simply nodded with an incredulous shrug of the shoulders he turned upon his heel undoubtedly he thought i had gone mad i have made a very important discovery his eyes flashed with excitement his hand was lifted in a menacing attitude for a moment neither of us spoke it is hard to say which was most excited you dont mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the scrawl i do was my desperate reply look at the sentence as dictated by you well but it means nothing was the angry answer nothing if you read from left to right but mark if from right to left backwards cried my uncle in wild amazement oh most cunning saknussemm and i to be such a blockhead he snatched up the document gazed at it with haggard eye and read it out as i had done it read as follows iin sneffels yoculis craterem kem delibat umbra scartaris julii intra calendas descende audas viator et terrestre centrum attinges kod feci arne saknussemmi which dog latin being translated reads as follows descend into the crater of yocul of sneffels which the shade of scartaris caresses before the kalends of july audacious traveler and you will reach the centre of the earth i did it arne saknussemm my uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy he looked radiant and handsome he rushed about the room wild with delight and satisfaction he knocked over tables and chairs he threw his books about until at last utterly exhausted he fell into his armchair whats oclock he asked about three my dinner does not seem to have done me much good he observed let me have something to eat we can then start at once get my portmanteau ready what for and your own he continued we start at once my horror may be conceived i resolved however to show no fear scientific reasons were the only ones likely to influence my uncle now there were many against this terrible journey the very idea of going down to the centre of the earth was simply absurd i determined therefore to argue the point after dinner my uncles rage was now directed against the cook for having no dinner ready my explanation however satisfied him and having gotten the key she soon contrived to get sufficient to satisfy our voracious appetites during the repast my uncle was rather gay than otherwise he made some of those peculiar jokes which belong exclusively to the learned as soon however as dessert was over he called me to his study we each took a chair on opposite sides of the table henry he said in a soft and winning voice i have always believed you ingenious and you have rendered me a service never to be forgotten without you this great this wondrous discovery would never have been made it is my duty therefore to insist on your sharing the glory he is in a good humor thought i ill soon let him know my opinion of glory in the first place he continued you must keep the whole affair a profound secret there is no more envious race of men than scientific discoverers many would start on the same journey at all events we will be the first in the field i doubt your having many competitors was my reply a man of real scientific acquirements would be delighted at the chance we should find a perfect stream of pilgrims on the traces of arne saknussemm if this document were once made public but my dear sir is not this paper very likely to be a hoax i urged the book in which we find it is sufficient proof of its authenticity he replied i thoroughly allow that the celebrated professor wrote the lines but only i believe as a kind of mystification was my answer scarcely were the words out of my mouth when i was sorry i had uttered them my uncle looked at me with a dark and gloomy scowl and i began to be alarmed for the results of our conversation his mood soon changed however and a smile took the place of a frown we shall see he remarked with decisive emphasis but see what is all this about yocul and sneffels and this scartaris i have never heard anything about them the very point to which i am coming i lately received from my friend augustus peterman of leipzig a map take down the third atlas from the second shelf series z plate 4 i rose went to the shelf and presently returned with the volume indicated this said my uncle is one of the best maps of iceland i believe it will settle all your doubts difficulties and objections with a grim hope to the contrary i stooped over the map chapter 4 we start on the journey you see the whole island is composed of volcanoes said the professor and remark carefully that they all bear the name of yocul the word is icelandic and means a glacier in most of the lofty mountains of that region the volcanic eruptions come forth from icebound caverns hence the name applied to every volcano on this extraordinary island but what does this word sneffels mean to this question i expected no rational answer i was mistaken follow my finger to the western coast of iceland there you see reykjavik its capital follow the direction of one of its innumerable fjords or arms of the sea and what do you see below the sixtyfifth degree of latitude a peninsulavery like a thighbone in shape and in the centre of it a mountain well thats sneffels i had nothing to say that is sneffelsa mountain about five thousand feet in height one of the most remarkable in the whole island and certainly doomed to be the most celebrated in the world for through its crater we shall reach the centre of the earth impossible cried i startled and shocked at the thought why impossible said professor hardwigg in his severest tones because its crater is choked with lava by burning rocksby infinite dangers but if it be extinct that would make a difference of course it would there are about three hundred volcanoes on the whole surface of the globebut the greater number are extinct of these sneffels is one no eruption has occurred since 1219in fact it has ceased to be a volcano at all after this what more could i say yesi thought of another objection but what is all this about scartaris and the kalends of july my uncle reflected deeply presently he gave forth the result of his reflections in a sententious tone what appears obscure to you to me is light this very phrase shows how particular saknussemm is in his directions the sneffels mountain has many craters he is careful therefore to point the exact one which is the highway into the interior of the earth he lets us know for this purpose that about the end of the month of june the shadow of mount scartaris falls upon the one crater there can be no doubt about the matter my uncle had an answer for everything i accept all your explanations i said and saknussemm is right he found out the entrance to the bowels of the earth he has indicated correctly but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is madness to suppose why so young man all scientific teaching theoretical and practical shows it to be impossible i care nothing for theories retorted my uncle but is it not wellknown that heat increases one degree for every seventy feet you descend into the earth which gives a fine idea of the central heat all the matters which compose the globe are in a state of incandescence even gold platinum and the hardest rocks are in a state of fusion what would become of us dont be alarmed at the heat my boy how so neither you nor anybody else know anything about the real state of the earths interior all modern experiments tend to explode the older theories were any such heat to exist the upper crust of the earth would be shattered to atoms and the world would be at an end a long learned and not uninteresting discussion followed which ended in this wise i do not believe in the dangers and difficulties which you henry seem to multiply and the only way to learn is like arne saknussemm to go and see well cried i overcome at last let us go and see though how we can do that in the dark is another mystery fear nothing we shall overcome these and many other difficulties besides as we approach the centre i expect to find it luminous nothing is impossible and now that we have come to a thorough understanding not a word to any living soul our success depends on secrecy and dispatch thus ended our memorable conference which roused a perfect fever in me leaving my uncle i went forth like one possessed reaching the banks of the elbe i began to think was all i had heard really and truly possible was my uncle in his sober senses and could the interior of the earth be reached was i the victim of a madman or was he a discoverer of rare courage and grandeur of conception to a certain extent i was anxious to be off i was afraid my enthusiasm would cool i determined to pack up at once at the end of an hour however on my way home i found that my feelings had very much changed im all abroad i cried tis a nightmarei must have dreamed it at this moment i came face to face with gretchen whom i warmly embraced so you have come to meet me she said how good of you but what is the matter well it was no use mincing the matter i told her all she listened with awe and for some minutes she could not speak well i at last said rather anxiously what a magnificent journey if i were only a man a journey worthy of the nephew of professor hardwigg i should look upon it as an honor to accompany him my dear gretchen i thought you would be the first to cry out against this mad enterprise no on the contrary i glory in it it is magnificent splendidan idea worthy of my father henry lawson i envy you this was as it were conclusive the final blow of all when we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and porters who were packing up he was pulling and hauling at a bell where have you been wasting your time your portmanteau is not packedmy papers are not in orderthe precious tailor has not brought my clothes nor my gaitersthe key of my carpet bag is gone i looked at him stupefied and still he tugged away at the bell we are really off then i said yesof course and yet you go out for a stroll unfortunate boy and when do we go the day after tomorrow at daybreak i heard no more but darted off to my little bedchamber and locked myself in there was no doubt about it now my uncle had been hard at work all the afternoon the garden was full of ropes rope ladders torches gourds iron clamps crowbars alpenstocks and pickaxesenough to load ten men i passed a terrible night i was called early the next day to learn that the resolution of my uncle was unchanged and irrevocable i also found my cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father next day at five oclock in the morning the post chaise was at the door gretchen and the old cook received the keys of the house and scarcely pausing to wish anyone goodby we started on our adventurous journey into the centre of the earth chapter 5 first lessons in climbing at altona a suburb of hamburg is the chief station of the kiel railway which was to take us to the shores of the belt in twenty minutes from the moment of our departure we were in holstein and our carriage entered the station our heavy luggage was taken out weighed labeled and placed in a huge van we then took our tickets and exactly at seven oclock were seated opposite each other in a firstclass railway carriage my uncle said nothing he was too busy examining his papers among which of course was the famous parchment and some letters of introduction from the danish consul which were to pave the way to an introduction to the governor of iceland my only amusement was looking out of the window but as we passed through a flat though fertile country this occupation was slightly monotonous in three hours we reached kiel and our baggage was at once transferred to the steamer we had now a day before us a delay of about ten hours which fact put my uncle in a towering passion we had nothing to do but to walk about the pretty town and bay at length however we went on board and at half past ten were steaming down the great belt it was a dark night with a strong breeze and a rough sea nothing being visible but the occasional fires on shore with here and there a lighthouse at seven in the morning we left korsor a little town on the western side of seeland here we took another railway which in three hours brought us to the capital copenhagen where scarcely taking time for refreshment my uncle hurried out to present one of his letters of introduction it was to the director of the museum of antiquities who having been informed that we were tourists bound for iceland did all he could to assist us one wretched hope sustained me now perhaps no vessel was bound for such distant parts alas a little danish schooner the ivalkyriei was to sail on the second of june for reykjavik the captain m bjarne was on board and was rather surprised at the energy and cordiality with which his future passenger shook him by the hand to him a voyage to iceland was merely a matter of course my uncle on the other hand considered the event of sublime importance the honest sailor took advantage of the professors enthusiasm to double the fare on tuesday morning at seven oclock be on board said m bjarne handing us our receipts excellent capital glorious remarked my uncle as we sat down to a late breakfast refresh yourself my boy and we will take a run through the town our meal concluded we went to the kongensnyetorw to the kings magnificent palace to the beautiful bridge over the canal near the museum to the immense cenotaph of thorwaldsen with its hideous naval groups to the castle of rosenberg and to all the other lions of the placenone of which my uncle even saw so absorbed was he in his anticipated triumphs but one thing struck his fancy and that was a certain singular steeple situated on the island of amak which is the southeast quarter of the city of copenhagen my uncle at once ordered me to turn my steps that way and accordingly we went on board the steam ferry boat which does duty on the canal and very soon reached the noted dockyard quay in the first instance we crossed some narrow streets where we met numerous groups of galley slaves with particolored trousers grey and yellow working under the orders and the sticks of severe taskmasters and finally reached the vorfrelserskirk this church exhibited nothing remarkable in itself in fact the worthy professor had only been attracted to it by one circumstance which was that its rather elevated steeple started from a circular platform after which there was an exterior staircase which wound round to the very summit let us ascend said my uncle but i never could climb church towers i cried i am subject to dizziness in my head the very reason why you should go up i want to cure you of a bad habit but my good sir i tell you to come what is the use of wasting so much valuable time it was impossible to dispute the dictatorial commands of my uncle i yielded with a groan on payment of a fee a verger gave us the key he for one was not partial to the ascent my uncle at once showed me the way running up the steps like a schoolboy i followed as well as i could though no sooner was i outside the tower than my head began to swim there was nothing of the eagle about me the earth was enough for me and no ambitious desire to soar ever entered my mind still things did not go badly until i had ascended 150 steps and was near the platform when i began to feel the rush of cold air i could scarcely stand when clutching the railings i looked upwards the railing was frail enough but nothing to those which skirted the terrible winding staircase that appeared from where i stood to ascend to the skies now then henry i cant do it i cried in accents of despair are you after all a coward sir said my uncle in a pitiless tone go up i say to this there was no reply possible and yet the keen air acted violently on my nervous system sky earth all seemed to swim round while the steeple rocked like a ship my legs gave way like those of a drunken man i crawled upon my hands and knees i hauled myself up slowly crawling like a snake presently i closed my eyes and allowed myself to be dragged upwards look around you said my uncle in a stern voice heaven knows what profound abysses you may have to look down this is excellent practice slowly and shivering all the while with cold i opened my eyes what then did i see my first glance was upwards at the cold fleecy clouds which as by some optical delusion appeared to stand still while the steeple the weathercock and our two selves were carried swiftly along far away on one side could be seen the grassy plain while on the other lay the sea bathed in translucent light the sund or sound as we call it could be discovered beyond the point of elsinore crowded with white sails which at that distance looked like the wings of seagulls while to the east could be made out the faroff coast of sweden the whole appeared a magic panorama but faint and bewildered as i was there was no remedy for it rise and stand up i must despite my protestations my first lesson lasted quite an hour when nearly two hours later i reached the bosom of mother earth i was like a rheumatic old man bent double with pain enough for one day said my uncle rubbing his hands we will begin again tomorrow there was no remedy my lessons lasted five days and at the end of that period i ascended blithely enough and found myself able to look down into the depths below without even winking and with some degree of pleasure chapter 6 our voyage to iceland the hour of departure came at last the night before the worthy mr thompson brought us the most cordial letters of introduction for baron trampe governor of iceland for m pictursson coadjutor to the bishop and for m finsen mayor of the town of reykjavik in return my uncle nearly crushed his hands so warmly did he shake them on the second of the month at two in the morning our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship ivalkyriei we followed and were very politely introduced by the captain to a small cabin with two standing bed places neither very well ventilated nor very comfortable but in the cause of science men are expected to suffer well and have we a fair wind cried my uncle in his most mellifluous accents an excellent wind replied captain bjarne we shall leave the sound going free with all sails set a few minutes afterwards the schooner started before the wind under all the canvas she could carry and entered the channel an hour later the capital of denmark seemed to sink into the waves and we were at no great distance from the coast of elsinore my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet sublime madman thought i you doubtless would approve our proceedings you might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the earth there to resolve your eternal doubts but no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls the fact is the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of denmark it is now the residence of the keeper of the strait of the sound and through that sound more than fifteen thousand vessels of all nations pass every year the castle of kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere as well as the tower of helsinborg which raises its head on the swedish bank and here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the kattegat the ivalkyriei was swift enough but with all sailing boats there is the same uncertainty her cargo was coal furniture pottery woolen clothing and a load of corn as usual the crew was small five danes doing the whole of the work how long will the voyage last asked my uncle well i should think about ten days replied the skipper unless indeed we meet with some northeast gales among the faroe islands at all events there will be no very considerable delay cried the impatient professor no mr hardwigg said the captain no fear of that at all events we shall get there some day towards evening the schooner doubled cape skagen the northernmost part of denmark crossed the skagerrak during the nightskirted the extreme point of norway through the gut of cape lindesnes and then reached the northern seas two days later we were not far from the coast of scotland somewhere near what danish sailors call peterhead and then the ivalkyriei stretched out direct for the faroe islands between orkney and shetland our vessel now felt the full force of the ocean waves and the wind shifting we with great difficulty made the faroe isles on the eighth day the captain made out myganness the westernmost of the isles and from that moment headed direct for portland a cape on the southern shores of the singular island for which we were bound the voyage offered no incident worthy of record i bore it very well but my uncle to his great annoyance and even shame was remarkably seasick this mal de mer troubled him the more that it prevented him from questioning captain bjarne as to the subject of sneffels as to the means of communication and the facilities of transport all these explanations he had to adjourn to the period of his arrival his time meanwhile was spent lying in bed groaning and dwelling anxiously on the hopedfor termination of the voyage i didnt pity him on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount myrdals yokul which the weather being clear we made out very readily the cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked and alone to meet the atlantic waves the ivalkyriei kept off the coast steering to the westward on all sides were to be seen whole schools of whales and sharks after some hours we came in sight of a solitary rock in the ocean forming a mighty vault through which the foaming waves poured with intense fury the islets of westman appeared to leap from the ocean being so low in the water as scarcely to be seen until you were right upon them from that moment the schooner was steered to the westward in order to round cape reykjanes the western point of iceland my uncle to his great disgust was unable even to crawl on deck so heavy a sea was on and thus lost the first view of the land of promise fortyeight hours later after a storm which drove us far to sea under bare poles we came once more in sight of land and were boarded by a pilot who after three hours of dangerous navigation brought the schooner safely to an anchor in the bay of faxa before reykjavik my uncle came out of his cabin pale haggard thin but full of enthusiasm his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel professor hardwigg was in haste to leave his prison or rather as he called it his hospital but before he attempted to do so he caught hold of my hand led me to the quarterdeck of the schooner took my arm with his left hand and pointed inland with his right over the northern part of the bay to where rose a high twopeaked mountaina double cone covered with eternal snow behold he whispered in an awestricken voice beholdmount sneffels then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us i followed and in a few minutes we stood upon the soil of mysterious iceland scarcely were we fairly on shore when there appeared before us a man of excellent appearance wearing the costume of a military officer he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the islandbaron trampe the professor knew whom he had to deal with he therefore handed him the letters from copenhagen and a brief conversation in danish followed to which i of course was a stranger and for a very good reason for i did not know the language in which they conversed i afterwards heard however that baron trampe placed himself entirely at the beck and call of professor hardwigg my uncle was most graciously received by m finsen the mayor who as far as costume went was quite as military as the governor but also from character and occupation quite as pacific as for his coadjutor m pictursson he was absent on an episcopal visit to the northern portion of the diocese we were therefore compelled to defer the pleasure of being presented to him his absence was however more than compensated by the presence of m fridriksson professor of natural science in the college of reykjavik a man of invaluable ability this modest scholar spoke no languages save icelandic and latin when therefore he addressed himself to me in the language of horace we at once came to understand one another he was in fact the only person that i did thoroughly understand during the whole period of my residence in this benighted island out of three rooms of which his house was composed two were placed at our service and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage the amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of reykjavik now harry said my uncle rubbing his hands an goes well the worse difficulty is now over how the worse difficulty over i cried in fresh amazement doubtless here we are in iceland nothing more remains but to descend into the bowels of the earth well sir to a certain extent you are right we have only to go downbut as far as i am concerned that is not the question i want to know how we are to get up again that is the least part of the business and does not in any way trouble me in the meantime there is not an hour to lose i am about to visit the public library very likely i may find there some manuscripts from the hand of saknussemm i shall be glad to consult them in the meanwhile i replied i will take a walk through the town will you not likewise do so i feel no interest in the subject said my uncle what for me is curious in this island is not what is above the surface but what is below i bowed by way of reply put on my hat and furred cloak and went out it was not an easy matter to lose oneself in the two streets of reykjavik i had therefore no need to ask my way the town lies on a flat and marshy plain between two hills a vast field of lava skirts it on one side falling away in terraces towards the sea on the other hand is the large bay of faxa bordered on the north by the enormous glacier of sneffels and in which bay the ivalkyriei was then the only vessel at anchor generally there were one or two english or french gunboats to watch and protect the fisheries in the offing they were now however absent on duty the longest of the streets of reykjavik runs parallel to the shore in this street the merchants and traders live in wooden huts made with beams of wood painted redmere log huts such as you find in the wilds of america the other street situated more to the west runs toward a little lake between the residences of the bishop and the other personages not engaged in commerce i had soon seen all i wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares here and there was a strip of discolored turf like an old wornout bit of woolen carpet and now and then a bit of kitchen garden in which grew potatoes cabbage and lettuce almost diminutive enough to suggest the idea of lilliput in the centre of the new commercial street i found the public cemetery enclosed by an earthen wall though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries from hence i went to the house of the governora mere hut in comparison with the mansion house of hamburgbut a palace alongside the other icelandic houses between the little lake and the town was the church built in simple protestant style and composed of calcined stones thrown up by volcanic action i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation upon an eminence close at hand was the national school in which were taught hebrew english french and danish in three hours my tour was complete the general impression upon my mind was sadness no trees no vegetation so to speakon all sides volcanic peaksthe huts of turf and earthmore like roofs than houses thanks to the heat of these residences grass grows on the roof which grass is carefully cut for hay i saw but few inhabitants during my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation the men appeared robust but heavy fairhaired like germans but of pensive mienexiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the polar circle sometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh but by no chance did they smile their costume consists of a coarse capote of black wool known in scandinavian countries as the vadmel a broadbrimmed hat trousers of red serge and a piece of leather tied with strings for a shoea coarse kind of moccasin the women though sadlooking and mournful had rather agreeable features without much expression they wear a bodice and petticoat of somber vadmel when unmarried they wear a little brown knitted cap over a crown of plaited hair but when married they cover their heads with a colored handkerchief over which they tie a white scarf chapter 7 conversation and discovery when i returned dinner was ready this meal was devoured by my worthy relative with avidity and voracity his shipboard diet had turned his interior into a perfect gulf the repast which was more danish than icelandic was in itself nothing but the excessive hospitality of our host made us enjoy it doubly the conversation turned upon scientific matters and m fridriksson asked my uncle what he thought of the public library library sir cried my uncle it appears to me a collection of useless odd volumes and a beggarly amount of empty shelves what cried m fridriksson why we have eight thousand volumes of most rare and valuable workssome in the scandinavian language besides all the new publications from copenhagen eight thousand volumes my dear sirwhy where are they cried my uncle scattered over the country professor hardwigg we are very studious my dear sir though we do live in iceland every farmer every laborer every fisherman can both read and writeand we think that books instead of being locked up in cupboards far from the sight of students should be distributed as widely as possible the books of our library are therefore passed from hand to hand without returning to the library shelves perhaps for years then when foreigners visit you there is nothing for them to see well sir foreigners have their own libraries and our first consideration is that our humbler classes should be highly educated fortunately the love of study is innate in the icelandic people in 1816 we founded a literary society and mechanics institute many foreign scholars of eminence are honorary members we publish books destined to educate our people and these books have rendered valuable services to our country allow me to have the honor professor hardwigg to enroll you as an honorary member my uncle who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific institution in europe immediately yielded to the amiable wishes of good m fridriksson and now he said after many expressions of gratitude and good will if you will tell me what books you expected to find perhaps i may be of some assistance to you i watched my uncle keenly for a minute or two he hesitated as if unwilling to speak to speak openly was perhaps to unveil his projects nevertheless after some reflection he made up his mind well m fridriksson he said in an easy unconcerned kind of way i was desirous of ascertaining if among other valuable works you had any of the learned arne saknussemm arne saknussemm cried the professor of reykjavik you speak of one of the most distinguished scholars of the sixteenth century of the great naturalist the great alchemist the great traveler exactly so one of the most distinguished men connected with icelandic science and literature as you say sir a man illustrious above all yes sir all this is true but his works we have none of them not in iceland there are none in iceland or elsewhere answered the other sadly why so because arne saknussemm was persecuted for heresy and in 1573 his works were publicly burnt at copenhagen by the hands of the common hangman very good capital murmured my uncle to the great astonishment of the worthy icelander you said sir yes yes all is clear i see the link in the chain everything is explained and i now understand why arne saknussemm put out of court forced to hide his magnificent discoveries was compelled to conceal beneath the veil of an incomprehensible cryptograph the secret what secret a secretwhich stammered my uncle have you discovered some wonderful manuscript cried m fridriksson no no i was carried away by my enthusiasm a mere supposition very good sir but really to turn to another subject i hope you will not leave our island without examining into its mineralogical riches well the fact is i am rather late so many learned men have been here before me yes yes but there is still much to be done cried m fridriksson you think so said my uncle his eyes twinkling with hidden satisfaction yes you have no idea how many unknown mountains glaciers volcanoes there are which remain to be studied without moving from where we sit i can show you one yonder on the edge of the horizon you see sneffels oh yes sneffels said my uncle one of the most curious volcanoes in existence the crater of which has been rarely visited extinct extinct any time these five hundred years was the ready reply well said my uncle who dug his nails into his flesh and pressed his knees tightly together to prevent himself leaping up with joy i have a great mind to begin my studies with an examination of the geological mysteries of this mount seffelfeiselwhat do you call it sneffels my dear sir this portion of the conversation took place in latin and i therefore understood all that had been said i could scarcely keep my countenance when i found my uncle so cunningly concealing his delight and satisfaction i must confess that his artful grimaces put on to conceal his happiness made him look like a new mephistopheles yes yes he continued your proposition delights me i will endeavor to climb to the summit of sneffels and if possible will descend into its crater i very much regret continued m fridriksson that my occupation will entirely preclude the possibility of my accompanying you it would have been both pleasurable and profitable if i could have spared the time no no a thousand times no cried my uncle i do not wish to disturb the serenity of any man i thank you however with all my heart the presence of one so learned as yourself would no doubt have been most useful but the duties of your office and profession before everything in the innocence of his simple heart our host did not perceive the irony of these remarks i entirely approve your project continued the icelander after some further remarks it is a good idea to begin by examining this volcano you will make a harvest of curious observations in the first place how do you propose to get to sneffels by sea i shall cross the bay of course that is the most rapid route of course but still it cannot be done why we have not an available boat in all reykjavik replied the other what is to be done you must go by land along the coast it is longer but much more interesting then i must have a guide of course and i have your very man somebody on whom i can depend yes an inhabitant of the peninsula on which sneffels is situated he is a very shrewd and worthy man with whom you will be pleased he speaks danish like a dane when can i see himtoday no tomorrow he will not be here before tomorrow be it replied my uncle with a deep sigh the conversation ended by compliments on both sides during the dinner my uncle had learned much as to the history of arne saknussemm the reasons for his mysterious and hieroglyphical document he also became aware that his host would not accompany him on his adventurous expedition and that next day we should have a guide chapter 8 the eiderdown hunteroff at last that evening i took a brief walk on the shore near reykjavik after which i returned to an early sleep on my bed of coarse planks where i slept the sleep of the just when i awoke i heard my uncle speaking loudly in the next room i rose hastily and joined him he was talking in danish with a man of tall stature and of perfectly herculean build this man appeared to be possessed of very great strength his eyes which started rather prominently from a very large head the face belonging to which was simple and naive appeared very quick and intelligent very long hair which even in england would have been accounted exceedingly red fell over his athletic shoulders this native of iceland was active and supple in appearance though he scarcely moved his arms being in fact one of those men who despise the habit of gesticulation common to southern people everything in this mans manner revealed a calm and phlegmatic temperament there was nothing indolent about him but his appearance spoke of tranquillity he was one of those who never seemed to expect anything from anybody who liked to work when he thought proper and whose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble i began to comprehend his character simply from the way in which he listened to the wild and impassioned verbiage of my worthy uncle while the excellent professor spoke sentence after sentence he stood with folded arms utterly still motionless to all my uncles gesticulations when he wanted to say no he moved his head from left to right when he acquiesced he nodded so slightly that you could scarcely see the undulation of his head this economy of motion was carried to the length of avarice judging from his appearance i should have been a long time before i had suspected him to be what he was a mighty hunter certainly his manner was not likely to frighten the game how then did he contrive to get at his prey my surprise was slightly modified when i knew that this tranquil and solemn personage was only a hunter of the eider duck the down of which is after all the greatest source of the icelanders wealth in the early days of summer the female of the eider a pretty sort of duck builds its nest amid the rocks of the fjordsthe name given to all narrow gulfs in scandinavian countrieswith which every part of the island is indented no sooner has the eider duck made her nest than she lines the inside of it with the softest down from her breast then comes the hunter or trader taking away the nest the poor bereaved female begins her task over again and this continues as long as any eider down is to be found when she can find no more the male bird sets to work to see what he can do as however his down is not so soft and has therefore no commercial value the hunter does not take the trouble to rob him of his nest lining the nest is accordingly finished the eggs are laid the little ones are born and next year the harvest of eider down is again collected now as the eider duck never selects steep rocks or aspects to build its nest but rather sloping and low cliffs near to the sea the icelandic hunter can carry on his trade operations without much difficulty he is like a farmer who has neither to plow to sow nor to harrow only to collect his harvest this grave sententious silent person as phlegmatic as an englishman on the french stage was named hans bjelke he had called upon us in consequence of the recommendation of m fridriksson he was in fact our future guide it struck me that had i sought the world over i could not have found a greater contradiction to my impulsive uncle they however readily understood one another neither of them had any thought about money one was ready to take all that was offered him the other ready to offer anything that was asked it may readily be conceived then that an understanding was soon come to between them now the understanding was that he was to take us to the village of stapi situated on the southern slope of the peninsula of sneffels at the very foot of the volcano hans the guide told us the distance was about twentytwo miles a journey which my uncle supposed would take about two days but when my uncle came to understand that they were danish miles of eight thousand yards each he was obliged to be more moderate in his ideas and considering the horrible roads we had to follow to allow eight or ten days for the journey four horses were prepared for us two to carry the baggage and two to bear the important weight of myself and uncle hans declared that nothing ever would make him climb on the back of any animal he knew every inch of that part of the coast and promised to take us the very shortest way his engagement with my uncle was by no means to cease with our arrival at stapi he was further to remain in his service during the whole time required for the completion of his scientific investigations at the fixed salary of three rixdollars a week being exactly fourteen shillings and twopence minus one farthing english currency one stipulation however was made by the guidethe money was to be paid to him every saturday night failing which his engagement was at an end the day of our departure was fixed my uncle wished to hand the eiderdown hunter an advance but he refused in one emphatic word efter which being translated from icelandic into plain english meansafter the treaty concluded our worthy guide retired without another word a splendid fellow said my uncle only he little suspects the marvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world you mean then i cried in amazement that he should accompany us to the interior of the earth yes replied my uncle why not there were yet fortyeight hours to elapse before we made our final start to my great regret our whole time was taken up in making preparations for our journey all our industry and ability were devoted to packing every object in the most advantageous mannerthe instruments on one side the arms on the other the tools here and the provisions there there were in fact four distinct groups the instruments were of course of the best manufacture 1 a centigrade thermometer of eigel counting up to 150 degrees which to me did not appear half enoughor too much too hot by half if the degree of heat was to ascend so highin which case we should certainly be cookednot enough if we wanted to ascertain the exact temperature of springs or metal in a state of fusion 2 a manometer worked by compressed air an instrument used to ascertain the upper atmospheric pressure on the level of the ocean perhaps a common barometer would not have done as well the atmospheric pressure being likely to increase in proportion as we descended below the surface of the earth 3 a firstclass chronometer made by boissonnas of geneva set at the meridian of hamburg from which germans calculate as the english do from greenwich and the french from paris 4 two compasses one for horizontal guidance the other to ascertain the dip 5 a night glass 6 two ruhmkorff coils which by means of a current of electricity would ensure us a very excellent easily carried and certain means of obtaining light 7 a voltaic battery on the newest principle1 1 thermometer ithermosi and imetroni measure an instrument for measuring the temperature of the airmanometer imanosiand imetroni measure an instrument to show the density or rarity of gaseschronometer ichronosi time and imetrosi measure a time measurer or superior watchruhmkorffs coil an instrument for producing currents of induced electricity of great intensity it consists of a coil of copper wire insulated by being covered with silk surrounded by another coil of fine wire also insulated in which a momentary current is induced when a current is passed through the inner coil from a voltaic battery when the apparatus is in action the gas becomes luminous and produces a white and continued light the battery and wire are carried in a leather bag which the traveler fastens by a strap to his shoulders the lantern is in front and enables the benighted wanderer to see in the most profound obscurity he may venture without fear of explosion into the midst of the most inflammable gases and the lantern will burn beneath the deepest waters h d ruhmkorff an able and learned chemist discovered the induction coil in 1864 he won the quinquennial french prize of £2000 for this ingenious application of electricitya voltaic battery so called from volta its designer is an apparatus consisting of a series of metal plates arranged in pairs and subjected to the action of saline solutions for producing currents of electricity our arms consisted of two rifles with two revolving sixshooters why these arms were provided it was impossible for me to say i had every reason to believe that we had neither wild beasts nor savage natives to fear my uncle on the other hand was quite as devoted to his arsenal as to his collection of instruments and above all was very careful with his provision of fulminating or gun cotton warranted to keep in any climate and of which the expansive force was known to be greater than that of ordinary gunpowder our tools consisted of two pickaxes two crowbars a silken ladder three ironshod alpine poles a hatchet a hammer a dozen wedges some pointed pieces of iron and a quantity of strong rope you may conceive that the whole made a tolerable parcel especially when i mention that the ladder itself was three hundred feet long then there came the important question of provisions the hamper was not very large but tolerably satisfactory for i knew that in concentrated essence of meat and biscuit there was enough to last six months the only liquid provided by my uncle was schiedam of water not a drop we had however an ample supply of gourds and my uncle counted on finding water and enough to fill them as soon as we commenced our downward journey my remarks as to the temperature the quality and even as to the possibility of none being found remained wholly without effect to make up the exact list of our traveling gearfor the guidance of future travelersadd that we carried a medicine and surgical chest with all apparatus necessary for wounds fractures and blows lint scissors lancetsin fact a perfect collection of horrible looking instruments a number of vials containing ammonia alcohol ether goulard water aromatic vinegar in fact every possible and impossible drugfinally all the materials for working the ruhmkorff coil my uncle had also been careful to lay in a goodly supply of tobacco several flasks of very fine gunpowder boxes of tinder besides a large belt crammed full of notes and gold good boots rendered watertight were to be found to the number of six in the tool box my boy with such clothing with such boots and such general equipment said my uncle in a state of rapturous delight we may hope to travel far it took a whole day to put all these matters in order in the evening we dined with baron trampe in company with the mayor of reykjavik and doctor hyaltalin the great medical man of iceland m fridriksson was not present and i was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor did not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the island unfortunately the consequence was that i did not understand a word that was said at dinnera kind of semiofficial reception one thing i can say my uncle never left off speaking the next day our labor came to an end our worthy host delighted my uncle professor hardwigg by giving him a good map of iceland a most important and precious document for a mineralogist our last evening was spent in a long conversation with m fridriksson whom i liked very muchthe more that i never expected to see him or anyone else again after this agreeable way of spending an hour or so i tried to sleep in vain with the exception of a few dozes my night was miserable at five oclock in the morning i was awakened from the only real half hours sleep of the night by the loud neighing of horses under my window i hastily dressed myself and went down into the street hans was engaged in putting the finishing stroke to our baggage which he did in a silent quiet way that won my admiration and yet he did it admirably well my uncle wasted a great deal of breath in giving him directions but worthy hans took not the slightest notice of his words at six oclock all our preparations were completed and m fridriksson shook hands heartily with us my uncle thanked him warmly in the icelandic language for his kind hospitality speaking truly from the heart as for myself i put together a few of my best latin phrases and paid him the highest compliments i could this fraternal and friendly duty performed we sallied forth and mounted our horses as soon as we were quite ready m fridriksson advanced and by way of farewell called after me in the words of virgilwords which appeared to have been made for us travelers starting for an uncertain destination et quacunque viam dederit fortuna sequamur and whichsoever way thou goest may fortune follow chapter 9 our startwe meet with adventures by the way the weather was overcast but settled when we commenced our adventurous and perilous journey we had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor drenching rain it was in fact real tourist weather as there was nothing i liked better than horse exercise the pleasure of riding through an unknown country caused the early part of our enterprise to be particularly agreeable to me i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty the truth is that my spirits rose so rapidly that i began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey after all i said to myself what do i risk simply to take a journey through a curious country to climb a remarkable mountain and if the worst comes to the worst to descend into the crater of an extinct volcano there could be no doubt that this was all this terrible saknussemm had done as to the existence of a gallery or of subterraneous passages leading into the interior of the earth the idea was simply absurd the hallucination of a distempered imagination all then that may be required of me i will do cheerfully and will create no difficulty it was just before we left reykjavik that i came to this decision hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur my uncle and i came behind cutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals iceland is one of the largest islands in europe it contains thirty thousand square miles of surface and has about seventy thousand inhabitants geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called sudvestr fjordungr hans on taking his departure from reykjavik had followed the line of the sea we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green they very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow the rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of the horizon through the misty fogs every now and then some heavy flakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light while certain lofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds their summits clearly visible above like jagged reefs rising from a troublous sea every now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground leaving us scarcely room to pass our horses however appeared not only well acquainted with the country but by a kind of instinct knew which was the best road my uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging forward his steed by whip spur or voice it was utterly useless to show any signs of impatience i could not help smiling to see him look so big on his little horse his long legs now and then touching the ground made him look like a sixfooted centaur good beast good beast he would cry i assure you that i begin to think no animal is more intelligent than an icelandic horse snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergsnothing stops him he is brave he is sober he is safe he never makes a false step never glides or slips from his path i dare to say that if any river any fjord has to be crossedand i have no doubt there will be manyyou will see him enter the water without hesitation like an amphibious animal and reach the opposite side in safety we must not however attempt to hurry him we must allow him to have his own way and i will undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a day we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide i have not the slightest anxiety about him that sort of people go ahead without knowing even what they are about look at hans he moves so little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued besides if he were to complain of weariness he could have the loan of my horse i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise my arms are rightbut my legs are getting a little stiff all this while we were advancing at a rapid pace the country we had reached was already nearly a desert here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or icelandic house built of wood earth fragments of lavalooking like beggars on the highway of life these wretched and miserable huts excited in us such pity that we felt half disposed to leave alms at every door in this country there are no roads paths are nearly unknown and vegetation poor as it was slowly as it reached perfection soon obliterated all traces of the few travelers who passed from place to place nevertheless this division of the province situated only a few miles from the capital is considered one of the best cultivated and most thickly peopled in all iceland what then must be the state of the less known and more distant parts of the island after traveling fully half a danish mile we had met neither a farmer at the door of his hut nor even a wandering shepherd with his wild and savage flock a few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally what then must we expect when we come to the upheaved regionsto the districts broken and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions we were to learn this all in good time i saw however on consulting the map that we avoided a good deal of this rough country by following the winding and desolate shores of the sea in reality the great volcanic movement of the island and all its attendant phenomena are concentrated in the interior of the island there horizontal layers or strata of rocks piled one upon the other eruptions of basaltic origin and streams of lava have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos some two hours or more after we had left the city of reykjavik we reached the little town called aoalkirkja or the principal church it consists simply of a few housesnot what in england or germany we should call a hamlet hans stopped here one half hour he shared our frugal breakfast answered yes and no to my uncles questions as to the nature of the road and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as laconic as usual gardar was his oneworded reply i took occasion to consult the map to see where gardar was to be found after looking keenly i found a small town of that name on the borders of the hvalfjord about four miles from reykjavik i pointed this out to my uncle who made a very energetic grimace only four miles out of twentytwo why it is only a little walk he was about to make some energetic observation to the guide but hans without taking the slightest notice of him went in front of the horses and walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always exhibited three hours later still traveling over those apparently interminable and sandy prairies we were compelled to go round the kollafjord an easier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs shortly after we entered a place of communal jurisdiction called ejulberg and the clock of which would then have struck twelve if any icelandic church had been rich enough to possess so valuable and useful an article these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watchesand never miss them here the horses were allowed to take some rest and refreshment then following a narrow strip of shore between high rocks and the sea they took us without further halt to the aoalkirkja of brantar and after another mile to saurboer annexia a chapel of ease situated on the southern bank of the hvalfjord it was four oclock in the evening and we had traveled four danish miles about equal to twenty english the fjord was in this place about half a mile in width the sweeping and broken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks the gulf was surrounded by rocky wallsa mighty cliff three thousand feet in height remarkable for its brown strata separated here and there by beds of tufa of a reddish hue now whatever may have been the intelligence of our horses i had not the slightest reliance upon them as a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd if they are really intelligent i said to myself they will certainly not make the attempt in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs but my uncle was in no humor to wait he dug his heels into the sides of his steed and made for the shore his horse went to the very edge of the water sniffed at the approaching wave and retreated my uncle who was sooth to say quite as obstinate as the beast he bestrode insisted on his making the desired advance this attempt was followed by a new refusal on the part of the horse which quietly shook his head this demonstration of rebellion was followed by a volley of words and a stout application of whipcord also followed by kicks on the part of the horse which threw its head and heels upwards and tried to throw his rider at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professors legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of rhodes wretched animal cried my uncle suddenly transformed into a foot passengerand as angry and ashamed as a dismounted cavalry officer on the field of battle farja said the guide tapping him familiarly on the shoulder what a ferry boat der answered hans pointing to where lay the boat in questionthere well i cried quite delighted with the information so it is why did you not say so before cried my uncle why not start at once tidvatten said the guide what does he say i asked considerably puzzled by the delay and the dialogue he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information of course i understandwe must wait till the tide serves for bida asked my uncle ja replied hans my uncle frowned stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where the boat lay i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fjord for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water as neither the ebb nor flow can then be felt the ferry boat was in no danger of being carried out to sea or dashed upon the rocky coast the favorable moment did not come until six oclock in the evening then my uncle myself and guide two boatmen and the four horses got into a very awkward flatbottom boat accustomed as i had been to the steam ferry boats of the elbe i found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion we were more than an hour in crossing the fjord but at length the passage was concluded without accident half an hour later we reached gardar chapter 10 traveling in iceland it ought one would have thought to have been night even in the sixtyfifth parallel of latitude but still the nocturnal illumination did not surprise me for in iceland during the months of june and july the sun never sets the temperature however was very much lower than i expected i was cold but even that did not affect me so much as ravenous hunger welcome indeed therefore was the hut which hospitably opened its doors to us it was merely the house of a peasant but in the matter of hospitality it was worthy of being the palace of a king as we alighted at the door the master of the house came forward held out his hand and without any further ceremony signaled to us to follow him we followed him for to accompany him was impossible a long narrow gloomy passage led into the interior of this habitation made from beams roughly squared by the ax this passage gave ingress to every room the chambers were four in numberthe kitchen the workshop where the weaving was carried on the general sleeping chamber of the family and the best room to which strangers were especially invited my uncle whose lofty stature had not been taken into consideration when the house was built contrived to knock his head against the beams of the roof we were introduced into our chamber a kind of large room with a hard earthen floor and lighted by a window the panes of which were made of a sort of parchment from the intestines of sheepvery far from transparent the bedding was composed of dry hay thrown into two long red wooden boxes ornamented with sentences painted in icelandic i really had no idea that we should be made so comfortable there was one objection to the house and that was the very powerful odor of dried fish of macerated meat and of sour milk which three fragrances combined did not at all suit my olfactory nerves as soon as we had freed ourselves from our heavy traveling costume the voice of our host was heard calling to us to come into the kitchen the only room in which the icelanders ever make any fire no matter how cold it may be my uncle nothing loath hastened to obey this hospitable and friendly invitation i followed the kitchen chimney was made on an antique model a large stone standing in the middle of the room was the fireplace above in the roof was a hole for the smoke to pass through this apartment was kitchen parlor and dining room all in one on our entrance our worthy host as if he had not seen us before advanced ceremoniously uttered a word which means be happy and then kissed both of us on the cheek his wife followed pronounced the same word with the same ceremonial then the husband and wife placing their right hands upon their hearts bowed profoundly this excellent icelandic woman was the mother of nineteen children who little and big rolled crawled and walked about in the midst of volumes of smoke arising from the angular fireplace in the middle of the room every now and then i could see a fresh white head and a slightly melancholy expression of countenance peering at me through the vapor both my uncle and myself however were very friendly with the whole party and before we were aware of it there were three or four of these little ones on our shoulders as many on our boxes and the rest hanging about our legs those who could speak kept crying out saellvertu in every possible and impossible key those who did not speak only made all the more noise this concert was interrupted by the announcement of supper at this moment our worthy guide the eiderduck hunter came in after seeing to the feeding and stabling of the horseswhich consisted in letting them loose to browse on the stunted green of the icelandic prairies there was little for them to eat but moss and some very dry and innutritious grass next day they were ready before the door some time before we were welcome said hans then tranquilly with the air of an automaton without any more expression in one kiss than another he embraced the host and hostess and their nineteen children this ceremony concluded to the satisfaction of all parties we all sat down to table that is twentyfour of us somewhat crowded those who were best off had only two juveniles on their knees as soon however as the inevitable soup was placed on the table the natural taciturnity common even to icelandic babies prevailed over all else our host filled our plates with a portion of lichen soup of iceland moss of by no means disagreeable flavor an enormous lump of fish floating in sour butter after that there came some skyr a kind of curds and whey served with biscuits and juniperberry juice to drink we had blanda skimmed milk with water i was hungry so hungry that by way of dessert i finished up with a basin of thick oaten porridge as soon as the meal was over the children disappeared whilst the grown people sat around the fireplace on which was placed turf heather cow dung and dried fishbones as soon as everybody was sufficiently warm a general dispersion took place all retiring to their respective couches our hostess offered to pull off our stockings and trousers according to the custom of the country but as we graciously declined to be so honored she left us to our bed of dry fodder next day at five in the morning we took our leave of these hospitable peasants my uncle had great difficulty in making them accept a sufficient and proper remuneration hans then gave the signal to start we had scarcely got a hundred yards from gardar when the character of the country changed the soil began to be marshy and boggy and less favorable to progress to the right the range of mountains was prolonged indefinitely like a great system of natural fortifications of which we skirted the glacis we met with numerous streams and rivulets which it was necessary to ford and that without wetting our baggage as we advanced the deserted appearance increased and yet now and then we could see human shadows flitting in the distance when a sudden turn of the track brought us within easy reach of one of these specters i felt a sudden impulse of disgust at the sight of a swollen head with shining skin utterly without hair and whose repulsive and revolting wounds could be seen through his rags the unhappy wretches never came forward to beg on the contrary they ran away not so quick however but that hans was able to salute them with the universal saellvertu spetelsk said he a leper explained my uncle the very sound of such a word caused a feeling of repulsion the horrible affliction known as leprosy which has almost vanished before the effects of modern science is common in iceland it is not contagious but hereditary so that marriage is strictly prohibited to these unfortunate creatures these poor lepers did not tend to enliven our journey the scene of which was inexpressibly sad and lonely the very last tufts of grassy vegetation appeared to die at our feet not a tree was to be seen except a few stunted willows about as big as blackberry bushes now and then we watched a falcon soaring in the grey and misty air taking his flight towards warmer and sunnier regions i could not help feeling a sense of melancholy come over me i sighed for my own native land and wished to be back with gretchen we were compelled to cross several little fjords and at last came to a real gulf the tide was at its height and we were able to go over at once and reach the hamlet of alftanes about a mile farther that evening after fording the alfa and the heta two rivers rich in trout and pike we were compelled to pass the night in a deserted house worthy of being haunted by all the fays of scandinavian mythology the king of cold had taken up his residence there and made us feel his presence all night the following day was remarkable by its lack of any particular incidents always the same damp and swampy soil the same dreary uniformity the same sad and monotonous aspect of scenery in the evening having accomplished the half of our projected journey we slept at the annexia of krosolbt for a whole mile we had under our feet nothing but lava this disposition of the soil is called ihrauni the crumbled lava on the surface was in some instances like ship cables stretched out horizontally in others coiled up in heaps an immense field of lava came from the neighboring mountains all extinct volcanoes but whose remains showed what once they had been here and there could be made out the steam from hot water springs there was no time however for us to take more than a cursory view of these phenomena we had to go forward with what speed we might soon the soft and swampy soil again appeared under the feet of our horses while at every hundred yards we came upon one or more small lakes our journey was now in a westerly direction we had in fact swept round the great bay of faxa and the twin white summits of sneffels rose to the clouds at a distance of less than five miles the horses now advanced rapidly the accidents and difficulties of the soil no longer checked them i confess that fatigue began to tell severely upon me but my uncle was as firm and as hard as he had been on the first day i could not help admiring both the excellent professor and the worthy guide for they appeared to regard this rugged expedition as a mere walk on saturday the 20th june at six oclock in the evening we reached budir a small town picturesquely situated on the shore of the ocean and here the guide asked for his money my uncle settled with him immediately it was now the family of hans himself that is to say his uncles his cousinsgerman who offered us hospitality we were exceedingly well received and without taking too much advantage of the goodness of these worthy people i should have liked very much to have rested with them after the fatigues of the journey but my uncle who did not require rest had no idea of anything of the kind and despite the fact that next day was sunday i was compelled once more to mount my steed the soil was again affected by the neighborhood of the mountains whose granite peered out of the ground like tops of an old oak we were skirting the enormous base of the mighty volcano my uncle never took his eyes from off it he could not keep from gesticulating and looking at it with a kind of sullen defiance as much as to say that is the giant i have made up my mind to conquer after four hours of steady traveling the horses stopped of themselves before the door of the presbytery of stapi chapter 11 we reach mount sneffelsthe reykir stapi is a town consisting of thirty huts built on a large plain of lava exposed to the rays of the sun reflected from the volcano it stretches its humble tenements along the end of a little fjord surrounded by a basaltic wall of the most singular character basalt is a brown rock of igneous origin it assumes regular forms which astonish by their singular appearance here we found nature proceeding geometrically and working quite after a human fashion as if she had employed the plummet line the compass and the rule if elsewhere she produces grand artistic effects by piling up huge masses without order or connectionif elsewhere we see truncated cones imperfect pyramids with an odd succession of lines here as if wishing to give a lesson in regularity and preceding the architects of the early ages she has erected a severe order of architecture which neither the splendors of babylon nor the marvels of greece ever surpassed i had often heard of the giants causeway in ireland and of fingals cave in one of the hebrides but the grand spectacle of a real basaltic formation had never yet come before my eyes this at stapi gave us an idea of one in all its wonderful beauty and grace the wall of the fjord like nearly the whole of the peninsula consisted of a series of vertical columns in height about thirty feet these upright pillars of stone of the finest proportions supported an archivault of horizontal columns which formed a kind of halfvaulted roof above the sea at certain intervals and below this natural basin the eye was pleased and surprised by the sight of oval openings through which the outward waves came thundering in volleys of foam some banks of basalt torn from their fastenings by the fury of the waves lay scattered on the ground like the ruins of an ancient templeruins eternally young over which the storms of ages swept without producing any perceptible effect this was the last stage of our journey hans had brought us along with fidelity and intelligence and i began to feel somewhat more comfortable when i reflected that he was to accompany us still farther on our way when we halted before the house of the rector a small and incommodious cabin neither handsome nor more comfortable than those of his neighbors i saw a man in the act of shoeing a horse a hammer in his hand and a leathern apron tied round his waist be happy said the eiderdown hunter using his national salutation in his own language god daggood day replied the former in excellent danish kyrkoherde cried hans turning round and introducing him to my uncle the rector repeated the worthy professor it appears my dear harry that this worthy man is the rector and is not above doing his own work during the speaking of these words the guide intimated to the kyrkoherde what was the true state of the case the good man ceasing from his occupation gave a kind of halloo upon which a tall woman almost a giantess came out of the hut she was at least six feet high which in that region is something considerable my first impression was one of horror i thought she had come to give us the icelandic kiss i had however nothing to fear for she did not even show much inclination to receive us into her house the room devoted to strangers appeared to me to be by far the worst in the presbytery it was narrow dirty and offensive there was however no choice about the matter the rector had no notion of practicing the usual cordial and antique hospitality far from it before the day was over i found we had to deal with a blacksmith a fisherman a hunter a carpenter anything but a clergyman it must be said in his favor that we had caught him on a weekday probably he appeared to greater advantage on the sunday these poor priests receive from the danish government a most ridiculously inadequate salary and collect one quarter of the tithe of their parishnot more than sixty marks current or about l3 10s sterling hence the necessity of working to live in truth we soon found that our host did not count civility among the cardinal virtues my uncle soon became aware of the kind of man he had to deal with instead of a worthy and learned scholar he found a dull illmannered peasant he therefore resolved to start on his great expedition as soon as possible he did not care about fatigue and resolved to spend a few days in the mountains the preparations for our departure were made the very next day after our arrival at stapi hans now hired three icelanders to take the place of the horseswhich could no longer carry our luggage when however these worthy islanders had reached the bottom of the crater they were to go back and leave us to ourselves this point was settled before they would agree to start on this occasion my uncle partly confided in hans the eiderduck hunter and gave him to understand that it was his intention to continue his exploration of the volcano to the last possible limits hans listened calmly and then nodded his head to go there or elsewhere to bury himself in the bowels of the earth or to travel over its summits was all the same to him as for me amused and occupied by the incidents of travel i had begun to forget the inevitable future but now i was once more destined to realize the actual state of affairs what was to be done run away but if i really had intended to leave professor hardwigg to his fate it should have been at hamburg and not at the foot of sneffels one idea above all others began to trouble me a very terrible idea and one calculated to shake the nerves of a man even less sensitive than myself let us consider the matter i said to myself we are going to ascend the sneffels mountain well and good we are about to pay a visit to the very bottom of the crater good still others have done it and did not perish from that course that however is not the whole matter to be considered if a road does really present itself by which to descend into the dark and subterraneous bowels of mother earth if this thrice unhappy saknussemm has really told the truth we shall be most certainly lost in the midst of the labyrinth of subterraneous galleries of the volcano now we have no evidence to prove that sneffels is really extinct what proof have we that an eruption is not shortly about to take place because the monster has slept soundly since 1219 does it follow that he is never to wake if he does wake what is to become of us these were questions worth thinking about and upon them i reflected long and deeply i could not lie down in search of sleep without dreaming of eruptions the more i thought the more i objected to be reduced to the state of dross and ashes i could stand it no longer so i determined at last to submit the whole case to my uncle in the most adroit manner possible and under the form of some totally irreconcilable hypothesis i sought him i laid before him my fears and then drew back in order to let him get his passion over at his ease i have been thinking about the matter he said in the quietest tone in the world what did he mean was he at last about to listen to the voice of reason did he think of suspending his projects it was almost too much happiness to be true i however made no remark in fact i was only too anxious not to interrupt him and allowed him to reflect at his leisure after some moments he spoke out i have been thinking about the matter he resumed ever since we have been at stapi my mind has been almost solely occupied with the grave question which has been submitted to me by yourselffor nothing would be unwiser and more inconsistent than to act with imprudence i heartily agree with you my dear uncle was my somewhat hopeful rejoinder it is now six hundred years since sneffels has spoken but though now reduced to a state of utter silence he may speak again new volcanic eruptions are always preceded by perfectly wellknown phenomena i have closely examined the inhabitants of this region i have carefully studied the soil and i beg to tell you emphatically my dear harry there will be no eruption at present as i listened to his positive affirmations i was stupefied and could say nothing i see you doubt my word said my uncle follow me i obeyed mechanically leaving the presbytery the professor took a road through an opening in the basaltic rock which led far away from the sea we were soon in open country if we could give such a name to a place all covered with volcanic deposits the whole land seemed crushed under the weight of enormous stonesof trap of basalt of granite of lava and of all other volcanic substances i could see many spouts of steam rising in the air these white vapors called in the icelandic language reykir come from hot water fountains and indicate by their violence the volcanic activity of the soil now the sight of these appeared to justify my apprehension i was therefore all the more surprised and mortified when my uncle thus addressed me you see all this smoke harry my boy yes sir well as long as you see them thus you have nothing to fear from the volcano how can that be be careful to remember this continued the professor at the approach of an eruption these spouts of vapor redouble their activityto disappear altogether during the period of volcanic eruption for the elastic fluids no longer having the necessary tension seek refuge in the interior of the crater instead of escaping through the fissures of the earth if then the steam remains in its normal or habitual state if their energy does not increase and if you add to this the remark that the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead calm you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate eruption but enough my boy when science has sent forth her fiatit is only to hear and obey i came back to the house quite downcast and disappointed my uncle had completely defeated me with his scientific arguments nevertheless i had still one hope and that was when once we were at the bottom of the crater that it would be impossible in default of a gallery or tunnel to descend any deeper and this despite all the learned saknussemms in the world i passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chest and after unheardof miseries and tortures found myself in the very depths of the earth from which i was suddenly launched into planetary space under the form of an eruptive rock next day june 23d hans calmly awaited us outside the presbytery with his three companions loaded with provisions tools and instruments two ironshod poles two guns and two large game bags were reserved for my uncle and myself hans who was a man who never forgot even the minutest precautions had added to our baggage a large skin full of water as an addition to our gourds this assured us water for eight days it was nine oclock in the morning when we were quite ready the rector and his huge wife or servant i never knew which stood at the door to see us off they appeared to be about to inflict on us the usual final kiss of the icelanders to our supreme astonishment their adieu took the shape of a formidable bill in which they even counted the use of the pastoral house really and truly the most abominable and dirty place i ever was in the worthy couple cheated and robbed us like a swiss innkeeper and made us feel by the sum we had to pay the splendors of their hospitality my uncle however paid without bargaining a man who had made up his mind to undertake a voyage into the interior of the earth is not the man to haggle over a few miserable rixdollars this important matter settled hans gave the signal for departure and some few moments later we had left stapi chapter 12 the ascent of mount sneffels the huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is above five thousand feet high sneffels is the termination of a long range of volcanic mountains of a different character to the system of the island itself one of its peculiarities is its two huge pointed summits from whence we started it was impossible to make out the real outlines of the peak against the grey field of sky all we could distinguish was a vast dome of white which fell downwards from the head of the giant the commencement of the great undertaking filled me with awe now that we had actually started i began to believe in the reality of the undertaking our party formed quite a procession we walked in single file preceded by hans the imperturbable eiderduck hunter he calmly led us by narrow paths where two persons could by no possibility walk abreast conversation was wholly impossible we had all the more opportunity to reflect and admire the awful grandeur of the scene around beyond the extraordinary basaltic wall of the fjord of stapi we found ourselves making our way through fibrous turf over which grew a scanty vegetation of grass the residuum of the ancient vegetation of the swampy peninsula the vast mass of this combustible the field of which as yet is utterly unexplored would suffice to warm iceland for a whole century this mighty turf pit measured from the bottom of certain ravines is often not less than seventy feet deep and presents to the eye the view of successive layers of black burnedup rocky detritus separated by thin streaks of porous sandstone the grandeur of the spectacle was undoubted as well as its arid and deserted air as a true nephew of the great professor hardwigg and despite my preoccupation and doleful fears of what was to come i observed with great interest the vast collection of mineralogical curiosities spread out before me in this vast museum of natural history looking back to my recent studies i went over in thought the whole geological history of iceland this extraordinary and curious island must have made its appearance from out of the great world of waters at a comparatively recent date like the coral islands of the pacific it may for aught we know be still rising by slow and imperceptible degrees if this really be the case its origin can be attributed to only one causethat of the continued action of subterranean fires this was a happy thought if so if this were true away with the theories of sir humphry davy away with the authority of the parchment of arne saknussemm the wonderful pretensions to discovery on the part of my uncleand to our journey all must end in smoke charmed with the idea i began more carefully to look about me a serious study of the soil was necessary to negative or confirm my hypothesis i took in every item of what i saw and i began to comprehend the succession of phenomena which had preceded its formation iceland being absolutely without sedimentary soil is composed exclusively of volcanic tufa that is to say of an agglomeration of stones and of rocks of a porous texture long before the existence of volcanoes it was composed of a solid body of massive trap rock lifted bodily and slowly out of the sea by the action of the centrifugal force at work in the earth the internal fires however had not as yet burst their bounds and flooded the exterior cake of mother earth with hot and raging lava my readers must excuse this brief and somewhat pedantic geological lecture but it is necessary to the complete understanding of what follows at a later period in the worlds history a huge and mighty fissure must reasoning by analogy have been dug diagonally from the southwest to the northeast of the island through which by degrees flowed the volcanic crust the great and wondrous phenomenon then went on without violencethe outpouring was enormous and the seething fused matter ejected from the bowels of the earth spread slowly and peacefully in the form of vast level plains or what are called mamelons or mounds it was at this epoch that the rocks called feldspars syenites and porphyries appeared but as a natural consequence of this overflow the depth of the island increased it can readily be believed what an enormous quantity of elastic fluids were piled up within its centre when at last it afforded no other openings after the process of cooling the crust had taken place at length a time came when despite the enormous thickness and weight of the upper crust the mechanical forces of the combustible gases below became so great that they actually upheaved the weighty back and made for themselves huge and gigantic shafts hence the volcanoes which suddenly arose through the upper crust and next the craters which burst forth at the summit of these new creations it will be seen that the first phenomena in connection with the formation of the island were simply eruptive to these however shortly succeeded the volcanic phenomena through the newly formed openings escaped the marvelous mass of basaltic stones with which the plain we were now crossing was covered we were trampling our way over heavy rocks of dark grey color which while cooling had been moulded into sixsided prisms in the back distance we could see a number of flattened cones which formerly were so many firevomiting mouths after the basaltic eruption was appeased and set at rest the volcano the force of which increased with that of the extinct craters gave free passage to the fiery overflow of lava and to the mass of cinders and pumice stone now scattered over the sides of the mountain like disheveled hair on the shoulders of a bacchante here in a nutshell i had the whole history of the phenomena from which iceland arose all take their rise in the fierce action of interior fires and to believe that the central mass did not remain in a state of liquid fire white hot was simply and purely madness this being satisfactorily proved qed what insensate folly to pretend to penetrate into the interior of the mighty earth this mental lecture delivered to myself while proceeding on a journey did me good i was quite reassured as to the fate of our enterprise and therefore went like a brave soldier mounting a bristling battery to the assault of old sneffels as we advanced the road became every moment more difficult the soil was broken and dangerous the rocks broke and gave way under our feet and we had to be scrupulously careful in order to avoid dangerous and constant falls hans advanced as calmly as if he had been walking over salisbury plain sometimes he would disappear behind huge blocks of stone and we momentarily lost sight of him there was a little period of anxiety and then there was a shrill whistle just to tell us where to look for him occasionally he would take it into his head to stop to pick up lumps of rock and silently pile them up into small heaps in order that we might not lose our way on our return he had no idea of the journey we were about to undertake at all events the precaution was a good one though how utterly useless and unnecessarybut i must not anticipate three hours of terrible fatigue walking incessantly had only brought us to the foot of the great mountain this will give some notion of what we had still to undergo suddenly however hans cried a haltthat is he made signs to that effectand a summary kind of breakfast was laid out on the lava before us my uncle who now was simply professor hardwigg was so eager to advance that he bolted his food like a greedy clown this halt for refreshment was also a halt for repose the professor was therefore compelled to wait the good pleasure of his imperturbable guide who did not give the signal for departure for a good hour the three icelanders who were as taciturn as their comrade did not say a word but went on eating and drinking very quietly and soberly from this our first real stage we began to ascend the slopes of the sneffels volcano its magnificent snowy nightcap as we began to call it by an optical delusion very common in mountains appeared to me to be close at hand and yet how many long weary hours must elapse before we reached its summit what unheardof fatigue must we endure the stones on the mountain side held together by no cement of soil bound together by no roots or creeping herbs gave way continually under our feet and went rushing below into the plains like a series of small avalanches in certain places the sides of this stupendous mountain were at an angle so steep that it was impossible to climb upwards and we were compelled to get round these obstacles as best we might those who understand alpine climbing will comprehend our difficulties often we were obliged to help each other along by means of our climbing poles i must say this for my uncle that he stuck as close to me as possible he never lost sight of me and on many occasions his arm supplied me with firm and solid support he was strong wiry and apparently insensible to fatigue another great advantage with him was that he had the innate sentiment of equilibriumfor he never slipped or failed in his steps the icelanders though heavily loaded climbed with the agility of mountaineers looking up every now and then at the height of the great volcano of sneffels it appeared to me wholly impossible to reach to the summit on that side at all events if the angle of inclination did not speedily change fortunately after an hour of unheardof fatigues and of gymnastic exercises that would have been trying to an acrobat we came to a vast field of ice which wholly surrounded the bottom of the cone of the volcano the natives called it the tablecloth probably from some such reason as the dwellers in the cape of good hope call their mountain table mountain and their roads table bay here to our mutual surprise we found an actual flight of stone steps which wonderfully assisted our ascent this singular flight of stairs was like everything else volcanic it had been formed by one of those torrents of stones cast up by the eruptions and of which the icelandic name is stina if this singular torrent had not been checked in its descent by the peculiar shape of the flanks of the mountain it would have swept into the sea and would have formed new islands such as it was it served us admirably the abrupt character of the slopes momentarily increased but these remarkable stone steps a little less difficult than those of the egyptian pyramids were the one simple natural means by which we were enabled to proceed about seven in the evening of that day after having clambered up two thousand of these rough steps we found ourselves overlooking a kind of spur or projection of the mountaina sort of buttress upon which the conelike crater properly so called leaned for support the ocean lay beneath us at a depth of more than three thousand two hundred feeta grand and mighty spectacle we had reached the region of eternal snows the cold was keen searching and intense the wind blew with extraordinary violence i was utterly exhausted my worthy uncle the professor saw clearly that my legs refused further service and that in fact i was utterly exhausted despite his hot and feverish impatience he decided with a sigh upon a halt he called the eiderduck hunter to his side that worthy however shook his head ofvanfor was his sole spoken reply it appears says my uncle with a woebegone look that we must go higher he then turned to hans and asked him to give some reason for this decisive response mistour replied the guide ja mistouryes the mistour cried one of the icelandic guides in a terrified tone it was the first time he had spoken what does this mysterious word signify i anxiously inquired look said my uncle i looked down upon the plain below and i saw a vast a prodigious volume of pulverized pumice stone of sand of dust rising to the heavens in the form of a mighty waterspout it resembled the fearful phenomenon of a similar character known to the travelers in the desert of the great sahara the wind was driving it directly towards that side of sneffels on which we were perched this opaque veil standing up between us and the sun projected a deep shadow on the flanks of the mountain if this sand spout broke over us we must all be infallibly destroyed crushed in its fearful embraces this extraordinary phenomenon very common when the wind shakes the glaciers and sweeps over the arid plains is in the icelandic tongue called mistour hastigt hastigt cried our guide now i certainly knew nothing of danish but i thoroughly understood that his gestures were meant to quicken us the guide turned rapidly in a direction which would take us to the back of the crater all the while ascending slightly we followed rapidly despite our excessive fatigue a quarter of an hour later hans paused to enable us to look back the mighty whirlwind of sand was spreading up the slope of the mountain to the very spot where we had proposed to halt huge stones were caught up cast into the air and thrown about as during an eruption we were happily a little out of the direction of the wind and therefore out of reach of danger but for the precaution and knowledge of our guide our dislocated bodies our crushed and broken limbs would have been cast to the wind like dust from some unknown meteor hans however did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare side of the cone we therefore continued our journey in a zigzag direction the fifteen hundred feet which remained to be accomplished took us at least five hours the turnings and windings the nothoroughfares the marches and marches turned that insignificant distance into at least three leagues i never felt such misery fatigue and exhaustion in my life i was ready to faint from hunger and cold the rarefied air at the same time painfully acted upon my lungs at last when i thought myself at my last gasp about eleven at night it being in that region quite dark we reached the summit of mount sneffels it was in an awful mood of mind that despite my fatigue before i descended into the crater which was to shelter us for the night i paused to behold the sun rise at midnight on the very day of its lowest declension and enjoyed the spectacle of its ghastly pale rays cast upon the isle which lay sleeping at our feet i no longer wondered at people traveling all the way from england to norway to behold this magical and wondrous spectacle chapter 13 the shadow of scartaris our supper was eaten with ease and rapidity after which everybody did the best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater the bed was hard the shelter unsatisfactory the situation painfullying in the open air five thousand feet above the level of the sea nevertheless it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as i did on that particular night i did not even dream so much for the effects of what my uncle called wholesome fatigue next day when we awoke under the rays of a bright and glorious sun we were nearly frozen by the keen air i left my granite couch and made one of the party to enjoy a view of the magnificent spectacle which developed itself panoramalike at our feet i stood upon the lofty summit of mount sneffels southern peak thence i was able to obtain a view of the greater part of the island the optical delusion common to all lofty heights raised the shores of the island while the central portions appeared depressed it was by no means too great a flight of fancy to believe that a giant picture was stretched out before me i could see the deep valleys that crossed each other in every direction i could see precipices looking like sides of wells lakes that seemed to be changed into ponds ponds that looked like puddles and rivers that were transformed into petty brooks to my right were glaciers upon glaciers and multiplied peaks topped with light clouds of smoke the undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains whose snowy summits make them look as if covered by foam recalled to my remembrance the surface of a stormbeaten ocean if i looked towards the west the ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur a continuation as it were of these fleecy hilltops where the earth ended and the sea began it was impossible for the eye to distinguish i soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in the mind when looking down from lofty hilltops and now i was able to do so without any feeling of nervousness having fortunately hardened myself to that kind of sublime contemplation i wholly forgot who i was and where i was i became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me i was presently however brought back to the realities of life by the arrival of the professor and hans who joined me upon the lofty summit of the peak my uncle turning in a westerly direction pointed out to me a light cloud of vapor a kind of haze with a faint outline of land rising out of the waters greenland said he greenland cried i in reply yes continued my uncle who always when explaining anything spoke as if he were in a professors chair we are not more than thirtyfive leagues distant from that wonderful land when the great annual breakup of the ice takes place white bears come over to iceland carried by the floating masses of ice from the north this however is a matter of little consequence we are now on the summit of the great the transcendent sneffels and here are its two peaks north and south hans will tell you the name by which the people of iceland call that on which we stand my uncle turned to the imperturbable guide who nodded and spoke as usualone word scartaris my uncle looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance a crater he said you hear i did hear but i was totally unable to make reply the crater of mount sneffels represented an inverted cone the gaping orifice apparently half a mile across the depth indefinite feet conceive what this hole must have been like when full of flame and thunder and lightning the bottom of the funnelshaped hollow was about five hundred feet in circumference by which it will be seen that the slope from the summit to the bottom was very gradual and we were therefore clearly able to get there without much fatigue or difficulty involuntarily i compared this crater to an enormous loaded cannon and the comparison completely terrified me to descend into the interior of a cannon i thought to myself when perhaps it is loaded and will go off at the least shock is the act of a madman but there was no longer any opportunity for me to hesitate hans with a perfectly calm and indifferent air took his usual post at the head of the adventurous little band i followed without uttering a syllable i felt like the lamb led to the slaughter in order to render the descent less difficult hans took his way down the interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion making as the sailors say long tracks to the eastward followed by equally long ones to the west it was necessary to walk through the midst of eruptive rocks some of which shaken in their balance went rolling down with thundering clamor to the bottom of the abyss these continual falls awoke echoes of singular power and effect many portions of the cone consisted of inferior glaciers hans whenever he met with one of these obstacles advanced with a great show of precaution sounding the soil with his long iron pole in order to discover fissures and layers of deep soft snow in many doubtful or dangerous places it became necessary for us to be tied together by a long rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to slip he would be supported by his companions this connecting link was doubtless a prudent precaution but not by any means unattended with danger nevertheless and despite all the manifold difficulties of the descent along slopes with which our guide was wholly unacquainted we made considerable progress without accident one of our great parcels of rope slipped from one of the iceland porters and rushed by a short cut to the bottom of the abyss by midday we were at the end of our journey i looked upwards and saw only the upper orifice of the cone which served as a circular frame to a very small portion of the skya portion which seemed to me singularly beautiful should i ever again gaze on that lovely sunlit sky the only exception to this extraordinary landscape was the peak of scartaris which seemed lost in the great void of the heavens the bottom of the crater was composed of three separate shafts through which during periods of eruption when sneffels was in action the great central furnace sent forth its burning lava and poisonous vapors each of these chimneys or shafts gaped openmouthed in our path i kept as far away from them as possible not even venturing to take the faintest peep downwards as for the professor after a rapid examination of their disposition and characteristics he became breathless and panting he ran from one to the other like a delighted schoolboy gesticulating wildly and uttering incomprehensible and disjointed phrases in all sorts of languages hans the guide and his humbler companions seated themselves on some piles of lava and looked silently on they clearly took my uncle for a lunatic andwaited the result suddenly the professor uttered a wild unearthly cry at first i imagined he had lost his footing and was falling headlong into one of the yawning gulfs nothing of the kind i saw him his arms spread out to their widest extent his legs stretched apart standing upright before an enormous pedestal high enough and black enough to bear a gigantic statue of pluto his attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied but his stupefaction was speedily changed to the wildest joy harry harry come here he cried make hastewonderfulwonderful unable to understand what he meant i turned to obey his commands neither hans nor the other icelanders moved a step look said the professor in something of the manner of the french general pointing out the pyramids to his army and fully partaking his stupefaction if not his joy i read on the eastern side of the huge block of stone the same characters half eaten away by the corrosive action of time the name to me a thousand times accursed illustration runic glyphs arne saknussemm cried my uncle now unbeliever do you begin to have faith it was totally impossible for me to answer a single word i went back to my pile of lava in a state of silent awe the evidence was unanswerable overwhelming in a few moments however my thoughts were far away back in my german home with gretchen and the old cook what would i have given for one of my cousins smiles for one of the ancient domestics omelettes and for my own feather bed how long i remained in this state i know not all i can say is that when at last i raised my head from between my hands there remained at the bottom of the crater only myself my uncle and hans the icelandic porters had been dismissed and were now descending the exterior slopes of mount sneffels on their way to stapi how heartily did i wish myself with them hans slept tranquilly at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava where he had made himself a rough and ready bed my uncle was walking about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage i had no desire neither had i the strength to move from my recumbent position taking example by the guide i gave way to a kind of painful somnolency during which i seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and shudderings in the mountain in this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater next morning a grey cloudy heavy sky hung like a funereal pall over the summit of the volcanic cone i did not notice it so much from the obscurity that reigned around us as from the rage with which my uncle was devoured i fully understood the reason and again a glimpse of hope made my heart leap with joy i will briefly explain the cause of the three openings which yawned beneath our steps only one could have been followed by the adventurous saknussemm according to the words of the learned icelander it was only to be known by that one particular mentioned in the cryptograph that the shadow of scartaris fell upon it just touching its mouth in the last days of the month of june we were in fact to consider the pointed peak as the stylus of an immense sundial the shadow of which pointed on one given day like the inexorable finger of fate to the yawning chasm which led into the interior of the earth now as often happens in these regions should the sun fail to burst through the clouds no shadow consequently no chance of discovering the right aperture we had already reached the 25th june if the kindly heavens would only remain densely clouded for six more days we should have to put off our voyage of discovery for another year when certainly there would be one person fewer in the party i already had sufficient of the mad and monstrous enterprise it would be utterly impossible to depict the impotent rage of professor hardwigg the day passed away and not the faintest outline of a shadow could be seen at the bottom of the crater hans the guide never moved from his place he must have been curious to know what we were about if indeed he could believe we were about anything as for my uncle he never addressed a word to me he was nursing his wrath to keep it warm his eyes fixed on the black and foggy atmosphere his complexion hideous with suppressed passion never had his eyes appeared so fierce his nose so aquiline his mouth so hard and firm on the 26th no change for the better a mixture of rain and snow fell during the whole day hans very quietly built himself a hut of lava into which he retired like diogenes into his tub i took a malicious delight in watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of the cone carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the vasty deep below my uncle was almost frantic to be sure it was enough to make even a patient man angry he had reached to a certain extent the goal of his desires and yet he was likely to be wrecked in port but if the heavens and the elements are capable of causing us much pain and sorrow there are two sides to a medal and there was reserved for professor hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surprise which was to compensate him for all his sufferings next day the sky was still overcast but on sunday the 28th the last day but two of the month with a sudden change of wind and a new moon there came a change of weather the sun poured its beaming rays to the very bottom of the crater each hillock every rock every stone every asperity of the soil had its share of the luminous effulgence and its shadow fell heavily on the soil among others to his insane delight the shadow of scartaris was marked and clear and moved slowly with the radiant start of day my uncle moved with it in a state of mental ecstasy at twelve oclock exactly when the sun had attained its highest altitude for the day the shadow fell upon the edge of the central pit here it is gasped the professor in an agony of joy here it iswe have found it forward my friends into the interior of the earth i looked curiously at hans to see what reply he would make to this terrific announcement forut said the guide tranquilly forward it is answered my uncle who was now in the seventh heaven of delight when we were quite ready our watches indicated thirteen minutes past one chapter 14 the real journey commences our real journey had now commenced hitherto our courage and determination had overcome all difficulties we were fatigued at times and that was all now we were about to encounter unknown and fearful dangers i had not as yet ventured to take a glimpse down the horrible abyss into which in a few minutes more i was about to plunge the fatal moment had however at last arrived i had still the option of refusing or accepting a share in this foolish and audacious enterprise but i was ashamed to show more fear than the eiderduck hunter hans seemed to accept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly with such calm indifference with such perfect recklessness of all danger that i actually blushed to appear less of a man than he had i been alone with my uncle i should certainly have sat down and argued the point fully but in the presence of the guide i held my tongue i gave one moment to the thought of my charming cousin and then i advanced to the mouth of the central shaft it measured about a hundred feet in diameter which made about three hundred in circumference i leaned over a rock which stood on its edge and looked down my hair stood on end my teeth chattered my limbs trembled i seemed utterly to lose my centre of gravity while my head was in a sort of whirl like that of a drunken man there is nothing more powerful than this attraction towards an abyss i was about to fall headlong into the gaping well when i was drawn back by a firm and powerful hand it was that of hans i had not taken lessons enough at the frelserskirk of copenhagen in the art of looking down from lofty eminences without blinking however few as the minutes were during which i gazed down this tremendous and even wondrous shaft i had a sufficient glimpse of it to give me some idea of its physical conformation its sides which were almost as perpendicular as those of a well presented numerous projections which doubtless would assist our descent it was a sort of wild and savage staircase without bannister or fence a rope fastened above near the surface would certainly support our weight and enable us to reach the bottom but how when we had arrived at its utmost depth were we to loosen it above this was i thought a question of some importance my uncle however was one of those men who are nearly always prepared with expedients he hit upon a very simple method of obviating this difficulty he unrolled a cord about as thick as my thumb and at least four hundred feet in length he allowed about half of it to go down the pit and catch in a hitch over a great block of lava which stood on the edge of the precipice this done he threw the second half after the first each of us could now descend by catching the two cords in one hand when about two hundred feet below all the explorer had to do was to let go one end and pull away at the other when the cord would come falling at his feet in order to go down farther all that was necessary was to continue the same operation this was a very excellent proposition and no doubt a correct one going down appeared to me easy enough it was the coming up again that now occupied my thoughts now said my uncle as soon as he had completed this important preparation let us see about the baggage it must be divided into three separate parcels and each of us must carry one on his back i allude to the more important and fragile articles my worthy and ingenious uncle did not appear to consider that we came under the denomination hans he continued you will take charge of the tools and some of the provisions you harry must take possession of another third of the provisions and of the arms i will load myself with the rest of the eatables and with the more delicate instruments but i exclaimed our clothes this mass of cord and ladderswho will undertake to carry them down they will go down of themselves and how so i asked you shall see my uncle was not fond of half measures nor did he like anything in the way of hesitation giving his orders to hans he had the whole of the nonfragile articles made up into one bundle and the packet firmly and solidly fastened was simply pitched over the edge of the gulf i heard the moaning of the suddenly displaced air and the noise of falling stones my uncle leaning over the abyss followed the descent of his luggage with a perfectly selfsatisfied air and did not rise until it had completely disappeared from sight now then he cried it is our turn i put it in good faith to any man of common sensewas it possible to hear this energetic cry without a shudder the professor fastened his case of instruments on his back hans took charge of the tools i of the arms the descent then commenced in the following order hans went first my uncle followed and i went last our progress was made in profound silencea silence only troubled by the fall of pieces of rock which breaking from the jagged sides fell with a roar into the depths below i allowed myself to slide so to speak holding frantically on the double cord with one hand and with the other keeping myself off the rocks by the assistance of my ironshod pole one idea was all the time impressed upon my brain i feared that the upper support would fail me the cord appeared to me far too fragile to bear the weight of three such persons as we were with our luggage i made as little use of it as possible trusting to my own agility and doing miracles in the way of feats of dexterity and strength upon the projecting shelves and spurs of lava which my feet seemed to clutch as strongly as my hands the guide went first i have said and when one of the slippery and frail supports broke from under his feet he had recourse to his usual monosyllabic way of speaking gif akt attentionlook out repeated my uncle in about half an hour we reached a kind of small terrace formed by a fragment of rock projecting some distance from the sides of the shaft hans now began to haul upon the cord on one side only the other going as quietly upward as the other came down it fell at last bringing with it a shower of small stones lava and dust a disagreeable kind of rain or hail while we were seated on this extraordinary bench i ventured once more to look downwards with a sigh i discovered that the bottom was still wholly invisible were we then going direct to the interior of the earth the performance with the cord recommenced and a quarter of an hour later we had reached to the depth of another two hundred feet i have very strong doubts if the most determined geologist would during that descent have studied the nature of the different layers of earth around him i did not trouble my head much about the matter whether we were among the combustible carbon silurians or primitive soil i neither knew nor cared to know not so the inveterate professor he must have taken notes all the way down for at one of our halts he began a brief lecture the farther we advance said he the greater is my confidence in the result the disposition of these volcanic strata absolutely confirms the theories of sir humphry davy we are still within the region of the primordial soil the soil in which took place the chemical operation of metals becoming inflamed by coming in contact with the air and water i at once regret the old and now forever exploded theory of a central fire at all events we shall soon know the truth such was the everlasting conclusion to which he came i however was very far from being in humor to discuss the matter i had something else to think of my silence was taken for consent and still we continued to go down at the expiration of three hours we were to all appearance as far off as ever from the bottom of the well when i looked upwards however i could see that the upper orifice was every minute decreasing in size the sides of the shaft were getting closer and closer together we were approaching the regions of eternal night and still we continued to descend at length i noticed that when pieces of stone were detached from the sides of this stupendous precipice they were swallowed up with less noise than before the final sound was sooner heard we were approaching the bottom of the abyss as i had been very careful to keep account of all the changes of cord which took place i was able to tell exactly what was the depth we had reached as well as the time it had taken we had shifted the rope twentyeight times each operation taking a quarter of an hour which in all made seven hours to this had to be added twentyeight pauses in all ten hours and a half we started at one it was now therefore about eleven oclock at night it does not require great knowledge of arithmetic to know that twentyeight times two hundred feet makes five thousand six hundred feet in all more than an english mile while i was making this mental calculation a voice broke the silence it was the voice of hans halt he cried i checked myself very suddenly just at the moment when i was about to kick my uncle on the head we have reached the end of our journey said the worthy professor in a satisfied tone what the interior of the earth said i slipping down to his side no you stupid fellow but we have reached the bottom of the well and i suppose there is no farther progress to be made i hopefully exclaimed oh yes i can dimly see a sort of tunnel which turns off obliquely to the right at all events we must see about that tomorrow let us sup now and seek slumber as best we may i thought it time but made no observations on that point i was fairly launched on a desperate course and all i had to do was to go forward hopefully and trustingly it was not even now quite dark the light filtering down in a most extraordinary manner we opened the provision bag ate a frugal supper and each did his best to find a bed amid the pile of stones dirt and lava which had accumulated for ages at the bottom of the shaft i happened to grope out the pile of ropes ladders and clothes which we had thrown down and upon them i stretched myself after such a days labor my rough bed seemed as soft as down for a while i lay in a sort of pleasant trance presently after lying quietly for some minutes i opened my eyes and looked upwards as i did so i made out a brilliant little dot at the extremity of this long gigantic telescope it was a star without scintillating rays according to my calculation it must be beta in the constellation of the little bear after this little bit of astronomical recreation i dropped into a sound sleep chapter 15 we continue our descent at eight oclock the next morning a faint kind of dawn of day awoke us the thousand and one prisms of the lava collected the light as it passed and brought it to us like a shower of sparks we were able with ease to see objects around us well harry my boy cried the delighted professor rubbing his hands together what say you now did you ever pass a more tranquil night in our house in the konigstrasse no deafening sounds of cart wheels no cries of hawkers no bad language from boatmen or watermen well uncle we are quite at the bottom of this wellbut to me there is something terrible in this calm why said the professor hotly one would say you were already beginning to be afraid how will you get on presently do you know that as yet we have not penetrated one inch into the bowels of the earth what can you mean sir was my bewildered and astonished reply i mean to say that we have only just reached the soil of the island itself this long vertical tube which ends at the bottom of the crater of sneffels ceases here just about on a level with the sea are you sure sir quite sure consult the barometer it was quite true that the mercury after rising gradually in the instrument as long as our descent was taking place had stopped precisely at twentynine degrees you perceive said the professor we have as yet only to endure the pressure of air i am curious to replace the barometer by the manometer the barometer in fact was about to become uselessas soon as the weight of the air was greater than what was calculated as above the level of the ocean but said i is it not very much to be feared that this everincreasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and inconvenient no said he we shall descend very slowly and our lungs will be gradually accustomed to breathe compressed air it is well known that aeronauts have gone so high as to be nearly without air at allwhy then should we not accustom ourselves to breathe when we have say a little too much of it for myself i am certain i shall prefer it let us not lose a moment where is the packet which preceded us in our descent i smilingly pointed it out to my uncle hans had not seen it and believed it caught somewhere above us huppe as he phrased it now said my uncle let us breakfast and break fast like people who have a long days work before them biscuit and dried meat washed down by some mouthfuls of water flavored with schiedam was the material of our luxurious meal as soon as it was finished my uncle took from his pocket a notebook destined to be filled by memoranda of our travels he had already placed his instruments in order and this is what he wrote monday june 29th chronometer 8h 17m morning barometer 296 inches thermometer 6 degrees 43 degrees fahr direction ese this last observation referred to the obscure gallery and was indicated to us by the compass now harry cried the professor in an enthusiastic tone of voice we are truly about to take our first step into the interior of the earth never before visited by man since the first creation of the world you may consider therefore that at this precise moment our travels really commence as my uncle made this remark he took in one hand the ruhmkorff coil apparatus which hung round his neck and with the other he put the electric current into communication with the worm of the lantern and a bright light at once illumined that dark and gloomy tunnel the effect was magical hans who carried the second apparatus had it also put into operation this ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled us to move along by the light of an artificial day amid even the flow of the most inflammable and combustible gases forward cried my uncle each took up his burden hans went first my uncle followed and i going third we entered the somber gallery just as we were about to engulf ourselves in this dismal passage i lifted up my head and through the tubelike shaft saw that iceland sky i was never to see again was it the last i should ever see of any sky the stream of lava flowing from the bowels of the earth in 1219 had forced itself a passage through the tunnel it lined the whole of the inside with its thick and brilliant coating the electric light added very greatly to the brilliancy of the effect the great difficulty of our journey now began how were we to prevent ourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane happily some cracks abrasures of the soil and other irregularities served the place of steps and we descended slowly allowing our heavy luggage to slip on before at the end of a long cord but that which served as steps under our feet became in other places stalactites the lava very porous in certain places took the form of little round blisters crystals of opaque quartz adorned with limpid drops of natural glass suspended to the roof like lusters seemed to take fire as we passed beneath them one would have fancied that the genii of romance were illuminating their underground palaces to receive the sons of men magnificent glorious i cried in a moment of involuntary enthusiasm what a spectacle uncle do you not admire these variegated shades of lava which run through a whole series of colors from reddish brown to pale yellowby the most insensible degrees and these crystals they appear like luminous globes you are beginning to see the charms of travel master harry cried my uncle wait a bit until we advance farther what we have as yet discovered is nothingonwards my boy onwards it would have been a far more correct and appropriate expression had he said let us slide for we were going down an inclined plane with perfect ease the compass indicated that we were moving in a southeasterly direction the flow of lava had never turned to the right or the left it had the inflexibility of a straight line nevertheless to my surprise we found no perceptible increase in heat this proved the theories of humphry davy to be founded on truth and more than once i found myself examining the thermometer in silent astonishment two hours after our departure it only marked fiftyfour degrees fahrenheit i had every reason to believe from this that our descent was far more horizontal than vertical as for discovering the exact depth to which we had attained nothing could be easier the professor as he advanced measured the angles of deviation and inclination but he kept the result of his observations to himself about eight oclock in the evening my uncle gave the signal for halting hans seated himself on the ground the lamps were hung to fissures in the lava rock we were now in a large cavern where air was not wanting on the contrary it abounded what could be the cause of thisto what atmospheric agitation could be ascribed this draught but this was a question which i did not care to discuss just then fatigue and hunger made me incapable of reasoning an unceasing march of seven hours had not been kept up without great exhaustion i was really and truly worn out and delighted enough i was to hear the word halt hans laid out some provisions on a lump of lava and we each supped with keen relish one thing however caused us great uneasinessour water reserve was already half exhausted my uncle had full confidence in finding subterranean resources but hitherto we had completely failed in so doing i could not help calling my uncles attention to the circumstance and you are surprised at this total absence of springs he said doubtlessi am very uneasy on the point we have certainly not enough water to last us five days be quite easy on that matter continued my uncle i answer for it we shall find plenty of waterin fact far more than we shall want but when when we once get through this crust of lava how can you expect springs to force their way through these solid stone walls but what is there to prove that this concrete mass of lava does not extend to the centre of the earth i dont think we have as yet done much in a vertical way what puts that into your head my boy asked my uncle mildly well it appears to me that if we had descended very far below the level of the seawe should find it rather hotter than we have according to your system said my uncle but what does the thermometer say scarcely fifteen degrees by reaumur which is only an increase of nine since our departure well and what conclusion does that bring you to inquired the professor the deduction i draw from this is very simple according to the most exact observations the augmentation of the temperature of the interior of the earth is one degree for every hundred feet but certain local causes may considerably modify this figure thus at yakoust in siberia it has been remarked that the heat increases a degree every thirtysix feet the difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain rocks in the neighborhood of an extinct volcano it has been remarked that the elevation of temperature was only one degree in every fiveandtwenty feet let us then go upon this calculationwhich is the most favorableand calculate calculate away my boy nothing easier said i pulling out my notebook and pencil nine times one hundred and twentyfive feet make a depth of eleven hundred and twentyfive feet archimedes could not have spoken more geometrically well well according to my observations we are at least ten thousand feet below the level of the sea can it be possible either my calculation is correct or there is no truth in figures the calculations of the professor were perfectly correct we were already six thousand feet deeper down in the bowels of the earth than anyone had ever been before the lowest known depth to which man had hitherto penetrated was in the mines of kitzbuhel in the tirol and those of wurttemberg the temperature which should have been eightyone was in this place only fifteen this was a matter for serious consideration chapter 16 the eastern tunnel the next day was tuesday the 30th of juneand at six oclock in the morning we resumed our journey we still continued to follow the gallery of lava a perfect natural pathway as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which in very old german houses serve the purpose of staircases this went on until seventeen minutes past twelve the precise instant at which we rejoined hans who having been somewhat in advance had suddenly stopped at last cried my uncle we have reached the end of the shaft i looked wonderingly about me we were in the centre of four cross pathssomber and narrow tunnels the question now arose as to which it was wise to take and this of itself was no small difficulty my uncle who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the matter before myself or the guide at once made up his mind he pointed quietly to the eastern tunnel and without delay we entered within its gloomy recesses besides had he entertained any feeling of hesitation it might have been prolonged indefinitely for there was no indication by which to determine on a choice it was absolutely necessary to trust to chance and good fortune the descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and winding sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches its course very like the aisles of a gothic cathedral the great artistic sculptors and builders of the middle ages might have here completed their studies with advantage many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of architectural beauty would have been discovered by them after passing through this phase of the cavernous way we suddenly came about a mile farther on upon a square system of arch adopted by the early romans projecting from the solid rock and keeping up the weight of the roof suddenly we would come upon a series of low subterranean tunnels which looked like beaver holes or the work of foxesthrough whose narrow and winding ways we had literally to crawl the heat still remained at quite a supportable degree with an involuntary shudder i reflected on what the heat must have been when the volcano of sneffels was pouring its smoke flames and streams of boiling lavaall of which must have come up by the road we were now following i could imagine the torrents of hot seething stone darting on bubbling up with accompaniments of smoke steam and sulphurous stench only to think of the consequences i mused if the old volcano were once more to set to work i did not communicate these rather unpleasant reflections to my uncle he not only would not have understood them but would have been intensely disgusted his only idea was to go ahead he walked he slid he clambered over piles of fragments he rolled down heaps of broken lava with an earnestness and conviction it was impossible not to admire at six oclock in the evening after a very wearisome journey but one not so fatiguing as before we had made six miles towards the southward but had not gone more than a mile downwards my uncle as usual gave the signal to halt we ate our meal in thoughtful silence and then retired to sleep our arrangements for the night were very primitive and simple a traveling rug in which each rolled himself was all our bedding we had no necessity to fear cold or any unpleasant visit travelers who bury themselves in the wilds and depths of the african desert who seek profit and pleasure in the forests of the new world are compelled to take it in turn to watch during the hours of sleep but in this region of the earth absolute solitude and complete security reigned supreme we had nothing to fear either from savages or from wild beasts after a nights sweet repose we awoke fresh and ready for action there being nothing to detain us we started on our journey we continued to burrow through the lava tunnel as before it was impossible to make out through what soil we were making way the tunnel moreover instead of going down into the bowels of the earth became absolutely horizontal i even thought after some examination that we were actually tending upwards about ten oclock in the day this state of things became so clear that finding the change very fatiguing i was obliged to slacken my pace and finally come to a halt well said the professor quickly what is the matter the fact is i am dreadfully tired was my earnest reply what cried my uncle tired after a three hours walk and by so easy a road easy enough i dare say but very fatiguing but how can that be when all we have to do is to go downwards i beg your pardon sir for some time i have noticed that we are going upwards upwards cried my uncle shrugging his shoulders how can that be there can be no doubt about it for the last half hour the slopes have been upwardand if we go on in this way much longer we shall find ourselves back in iceland my uncle shook his head with the air of a man who does not want to be convinced i tried to continue the conversation he would not answer me but once more gave the signal for departure his silence i thought was only caused by concentrated illtemper however this might be i once more took up my load and boldly and resolutely followed hans who was now in advance of my uncle i did not like to be beaten or even distanced i was naturally anxious not to lose sight of my companions the very idea of being left behind lost in that terrible labyrinth made me shiver as with the ague besides if the ascending path was more arduous and painful to clamber i had one source of secret consolation and delight it was to all appearance taking us back to the surface of the earth that of itself was hopeful every step i took confirmed me in my belief and i began already to build castles in the air in relation to my marriage with my pretty little cousin about twelve oclock there was a great and sudden change in the aspect of the rocky sides of the gallery i first noticed it from the diminution of the rays of light which cast back the reflection of the lamp from being coated with shining and resplendent lava it became living rock the sides were sloping walls which sometimes became quite vertical we were now in what the geological professors call a state of transition in the period of silurian stones so called because this specimen of early formation is very common in england in the counties formerly inhabited by the celtic nation known as silures i can see clearly now i cried the sediment from the waters which once covered the whole earth formed during the second period of its existence these schists and these calcareous rocks we are turning our backs on the granite rocks and are like people from hamburg who would go to lubeck by way of hanover i might just as well have kept my observations to myself my geological enthusiasm got the better however of my cooler judgment and professor hardwigg heard my observations what is the matter now he said in a tone of great gravity well cried i do you not see these different layers of calcareous rocks and the first indication of slate strata well what then we have arrived at that period of the worlds existence when the first plants and the first animals made their appearance you think so yes look examine and judge for yourself i induced the professor with some difficulty to cast the light of his lamp on the sides of the long winding gallery i expected some exclamation to burst from his lips i was very much mistaken the worthy professor never spoke a word it was impossible to say whether he understood me or not perhaps it was possible that in his pridemy uncle and a learned professorhe did not like to own that he was wrong in having chosen the eastern tunnel or was he determined at any price to go to the end of it it was quite evident we had left the region of lava and that the road by which we were going could not take us back to the great crater of mount sneffels as we went along i could not help ruminating on the whole question and asked myself if i did not lay too great a stress on these sudden and peculiar modifications of the earths crust after all i was very likely to be mistakenand it was within the range of probability and possibility that we were not making our way through the strata of rocks which i believed i recognized piled on the lower layer of granitic formation at all events if i am right i thought to myself i must certainly find some remains of primitive plants and it will be absolutely necessary to give way to such indubitable evidence let us have a good search i accordingly lost no opportunity of searching and had not gone more than about a hundred yards when the evidence i sought for cropped up in the most incontestable manner before my eyes it was quite natural that i should expect to find these signs for during the silurian period the seas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and vegetable species my feet so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava soil suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust the remains of plants and shells upon the walls themselves i could clearly make out the outline as plain as a sun picture of the fucus and the lycopods the worthy and excellent professor hardwigg could not of course make any mistake about the matter but i believe he deliberately closed his eyes and continued on his way with a firm and unalterable step i began to think that he was carrying his obstinacy a great deal too far i could no longer act with prudence or composure i stooped on a sudden and picked up an almost perfect shell which had undoubtedly belonged to some animal very much resembling some of the present day having secured the prize i followed in the wake of my uncle do you see this i said well said the professor with the most imperturbable tranquillity it is the shell of a crustaceous animal of the extinct order of the trilobites nothing more i assure you but cried i much troubled at his coolness do you draw no conclusion from it well if i may ask what conclusion do you draw from it yourself well i thought i know my boy what you would say and you are right perfectly and incontestably right we have finally abandoned the crust of lava and the road by which the lava ascended it is quite possible that i may have been mistaken but i shall be unable to discover my error until i get to the end of this gallery you are quite right as far as that is concerned i replied and i should highly approve of your decision if we had not to fear the greatest of all dangers and what is that want of water well my dear henry it cant be helped we must put ourselves on rations and on he went chapter 17 deeper and deeperthe coal mine in truth we were compelled to put ourselves upon rations our supply would certainly last not more than three days i found this out about supper time the worst part of the matter was that in what is called the transition rocks it was hardly to be expected we should meet with water i had read of the horrors of thirst and i knew that where we were a brief trial of its sufferings would put an end to our adventuresand our lives but it was utterly useless to discuss the matter with my uncle he would have answered by some axiom from plato during the whole of next day we proceeded on our journey through this interminable gallery arch after arch tunnel after tunnel we journeyed without exchanging a word we had become as mute and reticent as hans our guide the road had no longer an upward tendency at all events if it had it was not to be made out very clearly sometimes there could be no doubt that we were going downwards but this inclination was scarcely to be distinguished and was by no means reassuring to the professor because the character of the strata was in no wise modified and the transition character of the rocks became more and more marked it was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the sparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks and the old red sandstone one might have fancied oneself in one of those deep cuttings in devonshire which have given their name to this kind of soil some magnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery some of an agate grey with white veins of variegated character others of a yellow spotted color with red veins farther off might be seen samples of color in which cherrytinted seams were to be found in all their brightest shades the greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of primitive animals since the previous evening nature and creation had made considerable progress instead of the rudimentary trilobites i perceived the remains of a more perfect order among others the fish in which the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of the reptile the devonian seas were inhabited by a vast number of animals of this species which were deposited in tens of thousands in the rocks of new formation it was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal life of which man forms the summit my excellent uncle the professor appeared not to take notice of these warnings he was determined at any risk to proceed he must have been in expectation of one of two things either that a vertical well was about to open under his feet and thus allow him to continue his descent or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel us to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled but evening came again and to my horror neither hope was doomed to be realized on friday after a night when i began to feel the gnawing agony of thirst and when in consequence appetite decreased our little band rose and once more followed the turnings and windings the ascents and descents of this interminable gallery all were silent and gloomy i could see that even my uncle had ventured too far after about ten hours of further progressa progress dull and monotonous to the last degreei remarked that the reverberation and reflection of our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel had singularly diminished the marble the schist the calcareous rocks the red sandstone had disappeared leaving in their places a dark and gloomy wall somber and without brightness when we reached a remarkably narrow part of the tunnel i leaned my left hand against the rock when i took my hand away and happened to glance at it it was quite black we had reached the coal strata of the central earth a coal mine i cried a coal mine without miners responded my uncle a little severely how can we tell i can tell replied my uncle in a sharp and doctorial tone i am perfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal was not cut by the hand of man but whether it is the work of nature or not is of little concern to us the hour for our evening meal has comelet us sup hans the guide occupied himself in preparing food i had come to that point when i could no longer eat all i cared about were the few drops of water which fell to my share what i suffered it is useless to record the guides gourd not quite half full was all that was left for us three having finished their repast my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and sufferings as for me i could not sleep i lay counting the hours until morning the next morning saturday at six oclock we started again twenty minutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation from its mighty extent i saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do with this coal mine the vault above would have fallen in as it was it was only held together by some miracle of nature this mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide by about a hundred and fifty high the earth had evidently been cast apart by some violent subterranean commotion the mass giving way to some prodigious upheaving of nature had split in two leaving the vast gap into which we inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time the whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark and gloomy walls a geologist would have been able easily to follow the different phases of its formation the seams of coal were separated by strata of sandstone a compact clay which appeared to be crushed down by the weight from above at that period of the world which preceded the secondary epoch the earth was covered by a coating of enormous and rich vegetation due to the double action of tropical heat and perpetual humidity a vast atmospheric cloud of vapor surrounded the earth on all sides preventing the rays of the sun from ever reaching it hence the conclusion that these intense heats did not arise from this new source of caloric perhaps even the star of day was not quite ready for its brilliant workto illumine a universe climates did not as yet exist and a level heat pervaded the whole surface of the globethe same heat existing at the north pole as at the equator whence did it come from the interior of the earth in spite of all the learned theories of professor hardwigg a fierce and vehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great spheroid its action was felt even to the very topmost crust of the earth the plants then in existence being deprived of the vivifying rays of the sun had neither buds nor flowers nor odor but their roots drew a strong and vigorous life from the burning earth of early days there were but few of what may be called treesonly herbaceous plants immense turfs briers mosses rare families which however in those days were counted by tens and tens of thousands it is entirely to this exuberant vegetation that coal owes its origin the crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the seething boiling mass which was forever at work beneath hence arose numerous fissures and continual falling in of the upper earth the dense mass of plants being beneath the waters soon formed themselves into vast agglomerations then came about the action of natural chemistry in the depths of the ocean the vegetable mass at first became turf then thanks to the influence of gases and subterranean fermentation they underwent the complete process of mineralization in this manner in early days were formed those vast and prodigious layers of coal which an everincreasing consumption must utterly use up in about three centuries more if people do not find some more economic light than gas and some cheaper motive power than steam all these reflections the memories of my school studies came to my mind while i gazed upon these mighty accumulations of coal whose riches however are scarcely likely to be ever utilized the working of these mines could only be carried out at an expense that would never yield a profit the matter however is scarcely worthy consideration when coal is scattered over the whole surface of the globe within a few yards of the upper crust as i looked at these untouched strata therefore i knew they would remain as long as the world lasts while we still continued our journey i alone forgot the length of the road by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations the temperature continued to be very much the same as while we were traveling amid the lava and the schists on the other hand my sense of smell was much affected by a very powerful odor i immediately knew that the gallery was filled to overflowing with that dangerous gas the miners call fire damp the explosion of which has caused such fearful and terrible accidents making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a single hour happily we were able to illumine our progress by means of the ruhmkorff apparatus if we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this gallery torch in hand a terrible explosion would have put an end to our travels simply because no travelers would be left our excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the earth lasted until evening my uncle was scarcely able to conceal his impatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance in a horizontal direction the darkness dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear rendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery for myself i began to believe that it was simply interminable and would go on in the same manner for months suddenly at six oclock we stood in front of a wall to the right to the left above below nowhere was there any passage we had reached a spot where the rocks said in unmistakable accentsno thoroughfare i stood stupefied the guide simply folded his arms my uncle was silent well well so much the better cried my uncle at last i now know what we are about we are decidedly not upon the road followed by saknussemm all we have to do is to go back let us take one nights good rest and before three days are over i promise you we shall have regained the point where the galleries divided yes we may if our strength lasts as long i cried in a lamentable voice and why not tomorrow among us three there will not be a drop of water it is just gone and your courage with it said my uncle speaking in a severe tone what could i say i turned round on my side and from sheer exhaustion fell into a heavy sleep disturbed by dreams of water and i awoke unrefreshed i would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water chapter 18 the wrong road next day our departure took place at a very early hour there was no time for the least delay according to my account we had five days hard work to get back to the place where the galleries divided i can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return my uncle bore them like a man who has been in the wrongthat is with concentrated and suppressed anger hans with all the resignation of his pacific character and ii confess that i did nothing but complain and despair i had no heart for this bad fortune but there was one consolation defeat at the outset would probably upset the whole journey as i had expected from the first our supply of water gave completely out on our first days march our provision of liquids was reduced to our supply of schiedam but this horriblenay i will say itthis infernal liquor burnt the throat and i could not even bear the sight of it i found the temperature to be stifling i was paralyzed with fatigue more than once i was about to fall insensible to the ground the whole party then halted and the worthy icelander and my excellent uncle did their best to console and comfort me i could however plainly see that my uncle was contending painfully against the extreme fatigues of our journey and the awful torture generated by the absence of water at length a time came when i ceased to recollect anythingwhen all was one awfull hideous fantastic dream at last on tuesday the seventh of the month of july after crawling on our hands and knees for many hours more dead than alive we reached the point of junction between the galleries i lay like a log an inert mass of human flesh on the arid lava soil it was then ten in the morning hans and my uncle leaning against the wall tried to nibble away at some pieces of biscuit while deep groans and sighs escaped from my scorched and swollen lips then i fell off into a kind of deep lethargy presently i felt my uncle approach and lift me up tenderly in his arms poor boy i heard him say in a tone of deep commiseration i was profoundly touched by these words being by no means accustomed to signs of womanly weakness in the professor i caught his trembling hands in mine and gave them a gentle pressure he allowed me to do so without resistance looking at me kindly all the time his eyes were wet with tears i then saw him take the gourd which he wore at his side to my surprise or rather to my stupefaction he placed it to my lips drink my boy he said was it possible my ears had not deceived me was my uncle mad i looked at him with i am sure quite an idiotic expression i could not believe him i too much feared the counteraction of disappointment drink he said again had i heard aright before however i could ask myself the question a second time a mouthful of water cooled my parched lips and throatone mouthful but i do believe it brought me back to life i thanked my uncle by clasping my hands my heart was too full to speak yes said he one mouthful of water the very lastdo you hear my boythe very last i have taken care of it at the bottom of my bottle as the apple of my eye twenty times a hundred times i have resisted the fearful desire to drink it butnono harry i saved it for you my dear uncle i exclaimed and the big tears rolled down my hot and feverish cheeks yes my poor boy i knew that when you reached this place this crossroad in the earth you would fall down half dead and i saved my last drop of water in order to restore you thanks i cried thanks from my heart as little as my thirst was really quenched i had nevertheless partially recovered my strength the contracted muscles of my throat relaxedand the inflammation of my lips in some measure subsided at all events i was able to speak well i said there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do water has utterly failed us our journey is therefore at an end let us return while i spoke thus my uncle evidently avoided my face he held down his head his eyes were turned in every possible direction but the right one yes i continued getting excited by my own words we must go back to sneffels may heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit the light of day would that we now stood on the summit of the crater go back said my uncle speaking to himself and must it be so go backyes and without losing a single moment i vehemently cried for some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault so my dear harry said the professor in a very singular tone of voice those few drops of water have not sufficed to restore your energy and courage courage i cried i see that you are quite as downcast as beforeand still give way to discouragement and despair what then was the man made of and what other projects were entering his fertile and audacious brain you are not discouraged sir what give up just as we are on the verge of success he cried never never shall it be said that professor hardwigg retreated then we must make up our minds to perish i cried with a helpless sigh no harry my boy certainly not go leave me i am very far from desiring your death take hans with you ii will go on alonei you ask us to leave you leave me i say i have undertaken this dangerous and perilous adventure i will carry it to the endor i will never return to the surface of mother earth go harryonce more i say to yougo my uncle as he spoke was terribly excited his voice which before had been tender almost womanly became harsh and menacing he appeared to be struggling with desperate energy against the impossible i did not wish to abandon him at the bottom of that abyss while on the other hand the instinct of preservation told me to fly meanwhile our guide was looking on with profound calmness and indifference he appeared to be an unconcerned party and yet he perfectly well knew what was going on between us our gestures sufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to followand which each tried to influence the other to undertake but hans appeared not to take the slightest interest in what was really a question of life and death for us all but waited quite ready to obey the signal which should say go aloft or to resume his desperate journey into the interior of the earth how then i wished with all my heart and soul that i could make him understand my words my representations my sighs and groans the earnest accents in which i should have spoken would have convinced that cold hard nature those fearful dangers and perils of which the stolid guide had no idea i would have pointed them out to himi would have as it were made him see and feel between us we might have convinced the obstinate professor if the worst had come to the worst we could have compelled him to return to the summit of sneffels i quietly approached hans i caught his hand in mine he never moved a muscle i indicated to him the road to the top of the crater he remained motionless my panting form my haggard countenance must have indicated the extent of my sufferings the icelander gently shook his head and pointed to my uncle master he said the word is icelandic as well as english the master i cried beside myself with furymadman noi tell you he is not the master of our lives we must fly we must drag him with us do you hear me do you understand me i say i have already explained that i held hans by the arm i tried to make him rise from his seat i struggled with him and tried to force him away my uncle now interposed my good henry be calm he said you will obtain nothing from my devoted follower therefore listen to what i have to say i folded my arms as well as i could and looked my uncle full in the face this wretched want of water he said is the sole obstacle to the success of my project in the entire gallery made of lava schist and coal it is true we found not one liquid molecule it is quite possible that we may be more fortunate in the western tunnel my sole reply was to shake my head with an air of deep incredulity listen to me to the end said the professor in his wellknown lecturing voice while you lay yonder without life or motion i undertook a reconnoitering journey into the conformation of this other gallery i have discovered that it goes directly downwards into the bowels of the earth and in a few hours will take us to the old granitic formation in this we shall undoubtedly find innumerable springs the nature of the rock makes this a mathematical certainty and instinct agrees with logic to say that it is so now this is the serious proposition which i have to make to you when christopher columbus asked of his men three days to discover the land of promise his men ill terrified and hopeless yet gave him three daysand the new world was discovered now i the christopher columbus of this subterranean region only ask of you one more day if when that time is expired i have not found the water of which we are in search i swear to you i will give up my mighty enterprise and return to the earths surface despite my irritation and despair i knew how much it cost my uncle to make this proposition and to hold such conciliatory language under the circumstances what could i do but yield well i cried let it be as you wish and may heaven reward your superhuman energy but as unless we discover water our hours are numbered let us lose no time but go ahead chapter 19 the western gallerya new route our descent was now resumed by means of the second gallery hans took up his post in front as usual we had not gone more than a hundred yards when the professor carefully examined the walls this is the primitive formationwe are on the right roadonwards is our hope when the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the worlds morning the diminution of the volume of the earth produced a state of dislocation in its upper crust followed by ruptures crevasses and fissures the passage was a fissure of this kind through which ages ago had flowed the eruptive granite the thousand windings and turnings formed an inextricable labyrinth through the ancient soil as we descended successions of layers composing the primitive soil appeared with the utmost fidelity of detail geological science considers this primitive soil as the base of the mineral crust and it has recognized that it is composed of three different strata or layers all resting on the immovable rock known as granite no mineralogists had even found themselves placed in such a marvelous position to study nature in all her real and naked beauty the sounding rod a mere machine could not bring to the surface of the earth the objects of value for the study of its internal structure which we were about to see with our own eyes to touch with our own hands remember that i am writing this after the journey across the streak of the rocks colored by beautiful green tints wound metallic threads of copper of manganese with traces of platinum and gold i could not help gazing at these riches buried in the entrails of mother earth and of which no man would have the enjoyment to the end of time these treasuresmighty and inexhaustible were buried in the morning of the earths history at such awful depths that no crowbar or pickax will ever drag them from their tomb the light of our ruhmkorffs coil increased tenfold by the myriad of prismatic masses of rock sent its jets of fire in every direction and i could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond the rays of which produced myriads of extraordinary effects towards six oclock this festival of light began sensibly and visibly to decrease and soon almost ceased the sides of the gallery assumed a crystallized tint with a somber hue white mica began to commingle more freely with feldspar and quartz to form what may be called the true rockthe stone which is hard above all that supports without being crushed the four stories of the earths soil we were walled by an immense prison of granite it was now eight oclock and still there was no sign of water the sufferings i endured were horrible my uncle now kept at the head of our little column nothing could induce him to stop i meanwhile had but one real thought my ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a spring but no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listening ear but at last the time came when my limbs refused to carry me longer i contended heroically against the terrible tortures i endured because i did not wish to compel my uncle to halt to him i knew this would be the last fatal stroke suddenly i felt a deadly faintness come over me my eyes could no longer see my knees shook i gave one despairing cryand fell help help i am dying my uncle turned and slowly retraced his steps he looked at me with folded arms and then allowed one sentence to escape in hollow accents from his lips all is over the last thing i saw was a face fearfully distorted with pain and sorrow and then my eyes closed when i again opened them i saw my companions lying near me motionless wrapped in their huge traveling rugs were they asleep or dead for myself sleep was wholly out of the question my fainting fit over i was wakeful as the lark i suffered too much for sleep to visit my eyelidsthe more that i thought myself sick unto deathdying the last words spoken by my uncle seemed to be buzzing in my earsall is over and it was probable that he was right in the state of prostration to which i was reduced it was madness to think of ever again seeing the light of day above were miles upon miles of the earths crust as i thought of it i could fancy the whole weight resting on my shoulders i was crushed annihilated and exhausted myself in vain attempts to turn in my granite bed hours upon hours passed away a profound and terrible silence reigned around usa silence of the tomb nothing could make itself heard through these gigantic walls of granite the very thought was stupendous presently despite my apathy despite the kind of deadly calm into which i was cast something aroused me it was a slight but peculiar noise while i was watching intently i observed that the tunnel was becoming dark then gazing through the dim light that remained i thought i saw the icelander taking his departure lamp in hand why had he acted thus did hans the guide mean to abandon us my uncle lay fast asleepor dead i tried to cry out and arouse him my voice feebly issuing from my parched and fevered lips found no echo in that fearful place my throat was dry my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth the obscurity had by this time become intense and at last even the faint sound of the guides footsteps was lost in the blank distance my soul seemed filled with anguish and death appeared welcome only let it come quickly hans is leaving us i cried hanshans if you are a man come back these words were spoken to myself they could not be heard aloud nevertheless after the first few moments of terror were over i was ashamed of my suspicions against a man who hitherto had behaved so admirably nothing in his conduct or character justified suspicion moreover a moments reflection reassured me his departure could not be a flight instead of ascending the gallery he was going deeper down into the gulf had he had any bad design his way would have been upwards this reasoning calmed me a little and i began to hope the good and peaceful and imperturbable hans would certainly not have arisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive was he bent on a voyage of discovery during the deep still silence of the night had he at last heard that sweet murmur about which we were all so anxious chapter 20 water where is it a bitter disappointment during a long long weary hour there crossed my wildly delirious brain all sorts of reasons as to what could have aroused our quiet and faithful guide the most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through my head each more impossible than the other i believe i was either half or wholly mad suddenly however there arose as it were from the depths of the earth a voice of comfort it was the sound of footsteps hans was returning presently the uncertain light began to shine upon the walls of the passage and then it came in view far down the sloping tunnel at length hans himself appeared he approached my uncle placed his hand upon his shoulder and gently awakened him my uncle as soon as he saw who it was instantly arose well exclaimed the professor vatten said the hunter i did not know a single word of the danish language and yet by a sort of mysterious instinct i understood what the guide had said water water i cried in a wild and frantic tone clapping my hands and gesticulating like a madman water murmured my uncle in a voice of deep emotion and gratitude hvar where nedat below where below i understood every word i had caught the hunter by the hands and i shook them heartily while he looked on with perfect calmness the preparations for our departure did not take long and we were soon making a rapid descent into the tunnel an hour later we had advanced a thousand yards and descended two thousand feet at this moment i heard an accustomed and wellknown sound running along the floors of the granite rocka kind of dull and sullen roar like that of a distant waterfall during the first half hour of our advance not finding the discovered spring my feelings of intense suffering appeared to return once more i began to lose all hope my uncle however observing how downhearted i was again becoming took up the conversation hans was right he exclaimed enthusiastically that is the dull roaring of a torrent a torrent i cried delighted at even hearing the welcome words theres not the slightest doubt about it he replied a subterranean river is flowing beside us i made no reply but hastened on once more animated by hope i began not even to feel the deep fatigue which hitherto had overpowered me the very sound of this glorious murmuring water already refreshed me we could hear it increasing in volume every moment the torrent which for a long time could be heard flowing over our heads now ran distinctly along the left wall roaring rushing spluttering and still falling several times i passed my hand across the rock hoping to find some trace of humidityof the slightest percolation alas in vain again a half hour passed in the same weary toil again we advanced it now became evident that the hunter during his absence had not been able to carry his researches any farther guided by an instinct peculiar to the dwellers in mountain regions and water finders he smelt the living spring through the rock still he had not seen the precious liquid he had neither quenched his own thirst nor brought us one drop in his gourd moreover we soon made the disastrous discovery that if our progress continued we should soon be moving away from the torrent the sound of which gradually diminished we turned back hans halted at the precise spot where the sound of the torrent appeared nearest i could bear the suspense and suffering no longer and seated myself against the wall behind which i could hear the water seething and effervescing not two feet away but a solid wall of granite still separated us from it hans looked keenly at me and strange enough for once i thought i saw a smile on his imperturbable face he rose from a stone on which he had been seated and took up the lamp i could not help rising and following he moved slowly along the firm and solid granite wall i watched him with mingled curiosity and eagerness presently he halted and placed his ear against the dry stone moving slowly along and listening with the most extreme care and attention i understood at once that he was searching for the exact spot where the torrents roar was most plainly heard this point he soon found in the lateral wall on the left side about three feet above the level of the tunnel floor i was in a state of intense excitement i scarcely dared believe what the eiderduck hunter was about to do it was however impossible in a moment more not to both understand and applaud and even to smother him in my embraces when i saw him raise the heavy crowbar and commence an attack upon the rock itself saved i cried yes cried my uncle even more excited and delighted than myself hans is quite right oh the worthy excellent man we should never have thought of such an idea and nobody else i think would have done so such a process simple as it seemed would most certainly not have entered our heads nothing could be more dangerous than to begin to work with pickaxes in that particular part of the globe supposing while he was at work a breakup were to take place and supposing the torrent once having gained an inch were to take an ell and come pouring bodily through the broken rock not one of these dangers was chimerical they were only too real but at that moment no fear of falling in of the roof or even of inundation was capable of stopping us our thirst was so intense that to quench it we would have dug below the bed of old ocean itself hans went quietly to worka work which neither my uncle nor i would have undertaken at any price our impatience was so great that if we had once begun with pickax and crowbar the rock would soon have split into a hundred fragments the guide on the contrary calm ready moderate wore away the hard rock by little steady blows of his instrument making no attempt at a larger hole than about six inches as i stood i heard or i thought i heard the roar of the torrent momentarily increasing in loudness and at times i almost felt the pleasant sensation of water upon my parched lips at the end of what appeared an age hans had made a hole which enabled his crowbar to enter two feet into the solid rock he had been at work exactly an hour it appeared a dozen i was getting wild with impatience my uncle began to think of using more violent measures i had the greatest difficulty in checking him he had indeed just got hold of his crowbar when a loud and welcome hiss was heard then a stream or rather jet of water burst through the wall and came out with such force as to hit the opposite side hans the guide who was half upset by the shock was scarcely able to keep down a cry of pain and grief i understood his meaning when plunging my hands into the sparkling jet i myself gave a wild and frantic cry the water was scalding hot boiling i cried in bitter disappointment well never mind said my uncle it will soon get cool the tunnel began to be filled by clouds of vapor while a small stream ran away into the interior of the earth in a short time we had some sufficiently cool to drink we swallowed it in huge mouthfuls oh what exalted delightwhat rich and incomparable luxury what was this water whence did it come to us what was that the simple fact wasit was water and though still with a tingle of warmth about it it brought back to the heart that life which but for it must surely have faded away i drank greedily almost without tasting it when however i had almost quenched my ravenous thirst i made a discovery why it is chalybeate water a most excellent stomachic replied my uncle and highly mineralized here is a journey worth twenty to spa its very good i replied i should think so water found six miles under ground there is a peculiarly inky flavor about it which is by no means disagreeable hans may congratulate himself on having made a rare discovery what do you say nephew according to the usual custom of travelers to name the stream after him good said i and the name of hansbach hans brook was at once agreed upon hans was not a bit more proud after hearing our determination than he was before after having taken a very small modicum of the welcome refreshment he had seated himself in a corner with his usual imperturbable gravity now said i it is not worth while letting this water run to waste what is the use replied my uncle the source from which this river rises is inexhaustible never mind i continued let us fill our goatskin and gourds and then try to stop the opening up my advice after some hesitation was followed or attempted to be followed hans picked up all the broken pieces of granite he had knocked out and using some tow he happened to have about him tried to shut up the fissure he had made in the wall all he did was to scald his hands the pressure was too great and all our attempts were utter failures it is evident i remarked that the upper surface of these springs is situated at a very great height aboveas we may fairly infer from the great pressure of the jet that is by no means doubtful replied my uncle if this column of water is about thirtytwo thousand feet high the atmospheric pressure must be something enormous but a new idea has just struck me and what is that why be at so much trouble to close this aperture because i hesitated and stammered having no real reason when our water bottles are empty we are not at all sure that we shall be able to fill them observed my uncle i think that is very probable well then let this water run it will of course naturally follow in our track and will serve to guide and refresh us i think the idea a good one i cried in reply and with this rivulet as a companion there is no further reason why we should not succeed in our marvelous project ah my boy said the professor laughing after all you are coming round more than that i am now confident of ultimate success one moment nephew mine let us begin by taking some hours of repose i had utterly forgotten that it was night the chronometer however informed me of the fact soon we were sufficiently restored and refreshed and had all fallen into a profound sleep chapter 21 under the ocean by the next day we had nearly forgotten our past sufferings the first sensation i experienced was surprise at not being thirsty and i actually asked myself the reason the running stream which flowed in rippling wavelets at my feet was the satisfactory reply we breakfasted with a good appetite and then drank our fill of the excellent water i felt myself quite a new man ready to go anywhere my uncle chose to lead i began to think why should not a man as seriously convinced as my uncle succeed with so excellent a guide as worthy hans and so devoted a nephew as myself these were the brilliant ideas which now invaded my brain had the proposition now been made to go back to the summit of mount sneffels i should have declined the offer in a most indignant manner but fortunately there was no question of going up we were about to descend farther into the interior of the earth let us be moving i cried awakening the echoes of the old world we resumed our march on thursday at eight oclock in the morning the great granite tunnel as it went round by sinuous and winding ways presented every now and then sharp turns and in fact all the appearance of a labyrinth its direction however was in general towards the southwest my uncle made several pauses in order to consult his compass the gallery now began to trend downwards in a horizontal direction with about two inches of fall in every furlong the murmuring stream flowed quietly at our feet i could not but compare it to some familiar spirit guiding us through the earth and i dabbled my fingers in its tepid water which sang like a naiad as we progressed my good humor began to assume a mythological character as for my uncle he began to complain of the horizontal character of the road his route he found began to be indefinitely prolonged instead of sliding down the celestial ray according to his expression but we had no choice and as long as our road led towards the centrehowever little progress we made there was no reason to complain moreover from time to time the slopes were much greater the naiad sang more loudly and we began to dip downwards in earnest as yet however i felt no painful sensation i had not got over the excitement of the discovery of water that day and the next we did a considerable amount of horizontal and relatively very little vertical traveling on friday evening the tenth of july according to our estimation we ought to have been thirty leagues to the southeast of reykjavik and about two leagues and a half deep we now received a rather startling surprise under our feet there opened a horrible well my uncle was so delighted that he actually clapped his handsas he saw how steep and sharp was the descent ah ah he cried in rapturous delight this will take us a long way look at the projections of the rock hah he exclaimed its a fearful staircase hans however who in all our troubles had never given up the ropes took care so to dispose of them as to prevent any accidents our descent then began i dare not call it a perilous descent for i was already too familiar with that sort of work to look upon it as anything but a very ordinary affair this well was a kind of narrow opening in the massive granite of the kind known as a fissure the contraction of the terrestrial scaffolding when it suddenly cooled had been evidently the cause if it had ever served in former times as a kind of funnel through which passed the eruptive masses vomited by sneffels i was at a loss to explain how it had left no mark we were in fact descending a spiral something like those winding staircases in use in modern houses we were compelled every quarter of an hour or thereabouts to sit down in order to rest our legs our calves ached we then seated ourselves on some projecting rock with our legs hanging over and gossiped while we ate a mouthfuldrinking still from the pleasantly warm running stream which had not deserted us it is scarcely necessary to say that in this curiously shaped fissure the hansbach had become a cascade to the detriment of its size it was still however sufficient and more for our wants besides we knew that as soon as the declivity ceased to be so abrupt the stream must resume its peaceful course at this moment it reminded me of my uncle his impatience and rage while when it flowed more peacefully i pictured to myself the placidity of the icelandic guide during the whole of two days the sixth and seventh of july we followed the extraordinary spiral staircase of the fissure penetrating two leagues farther into the crust of the earth which put us five leagues below the level of the sea on the eighth however at twelve oclock in the day the fissure suddenly assumed a much more gentle slope still trending in a southeast direction the road now became comparatively easy and at the same time dreadfully monotonous it would have been difficult for matters to have turned out otherwise our peculiar journey had no chance of being diversified by landscape and scenery at all events such was my idea at length on wednesday the fifteenth we were actually seven leagues twentyone miles below the surface of the earth and fifty leagues distant from the mountain of sneffels though if the truth be told we were very tired our health had resisted all suffering and was in a most satisfactory state our travelers box of medicaments had not even been opened my uncle was careful to note every hour the indications of the compass of the manometer and of the thermometer all which he afterwards published in his elaborate philosophical and scientific account of our remarkable voyage he was therefore able to give an exact relation of the situation when therefore he informed me that we were fifty leagues in a horizontal direction distant from our starting point i could not suppress a loud exclamation what is the matter now cried my uncle nothing very important only an idea has entered my head was my reply well out with it my boy it is my opinion that if your calculations are correct we are no longer under iceland do you think so we can very easily find out i replied pulling out a map and compasses you see i said after careful measurement that i am not mistaken we are far beyond cape portland and those fifty leagues to the southeast will take us into the open sea under the open sea cried my uncle rubbing his hands with a delighted air yes i cried no doubt old ocean flows over our heads well my dear boy what can be more natural do you not know that in the neighborhood of newcastle there are coal mines which have been worked far out under the sea now my worthy uncle the professor no doubt regarded this discovery as a very simple fact but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one and yet when one came to think the matter over seriously what mattered it whether the plains and mountains of iceland were suspended over our devoted heads or the mighty billows of the atlantic ocean the whole question rested on the solidity of the granite roof above us however i soon got used to the ideal for the passage now level now running down and still always to the southeast kept going deeper and deeper into the profound abysses of mother earth three days later on the eighteenth day of july on a saturday we reached a kind of vast grotto my uncle here paid hans his usual rixdollars and it was decided that the next day should be a day of rest chapter 22 sunday below ground i awoke on sunday morning without any sense of hurry and bustle attendant on an immediate departure though the day to be devoted to repose and reflection was spent under such strange circumstances and in so wonderful a place the idea was a pleasant one besides we all began to get used to this kind of existence i had almost ceased to think of the sun of the moon of the stars of the trees houses and towns in fact about any terrestrial necessities in our peculiar position we were far above such reflections the grotto was a vast and magnificent hall along its granitic soil the stream flowed placidly and pleasantly so great a distance was it now from its fiery source that its water was scarcely lukewarm and could be drunk without delay or difficulty after a frugal breakfast the professor made up his mind to devote some hours to putting his notes and calculations in order in the first place he said i have a good many to verify and prove in order that we may know our exact position i wish to be able on our return to the upper regions to make a map of our journey a kind of vertical section of the globe which will be as it were the profile of the expedition that would indeed be a curious work uncle but can you make your observations with anything like certainty and precision i can i have never on any occasion failed to note with great care the angles and slopes i am certain as to having made no mistake take the compass and examine how she points i looked at the instrument with care east one quarter southeast very good resumed the professor noting the observation and going through some rapid calculations i make out that we have journeyed two hundred and fifty miles from the point of our departure then the mighty waves of the atlantic are rolling over our heads certainly and at this very moment it is possible that fierce tempests are raging above and that men and ships are battling against the angry blasts just over our heads it is quite within the range of possibility rejoined my uncle smiling and that whales are playing in shoals thrashing the bottom of the sea the roof of our adamantine prison be quite at rest on that point there is no danger of their breaking through but to return to our calculations we are to the southeast two hundred and fifty miles from the base of sneffels and according to my preceding notes i think we have gone sixteen leagues in a downward direction sixteen leaguesfifty miles i cried i am sure of it but that is the extreme limit allowed by science for the thickness of the earths crust i replied referring to my geological studies i do not contravene that assertion was his quiet answer and at this stage of our journey according to all known laws on the increase of heat there should be here a temperature of ififteen hundred degrees of reaumuri there should beyou say my boy in which case this granite would not exist but be in a state of fusion but you perceive my boy that it is not so and that facts as usual are very stubborn things overruling all theories i am forced to yield to the evidence of my senses but i am nevertheless very much surprised what heat does the thermometer really indicate continued the philosopher twentyseven sixtenths so that science is wrong by fourteen hundred and seventyfour degrees and fourtenths according to which it is demonstrated that the proportional increase in temperature is an exploded error humphry davy here shines forth in all his glory he is right and i have acted wisely to believe him have you any answer to make to this statement had i chosen to have spoken i might have said a great deal i in no way admitted the theory of humphry davyi still held out for the theory of proportional increase of heat though i did not feel it i was far more willing to allow that this chimney of an extinct volcano was covered by lava of a kind refractory to heatin fact a bad conductorwhich did not allow the great increase of temperature to percolate through its sides the hot water jet supported my view of the matter but without entering on a long and useless discussion or seeking for new arguments to controvert my uncle i contented myself with taking up facts as they were well sir i take for granted that all your calculations are correct but allow me to draw from them a rigorous and definite conclusion go on my boyhave your say cried my uncle goodhumoredly at the place where we now are under the latitude of iceland the terrestrial depth is about fifteen hundred and eightythree leagues fifteen hundred eightythree and a quarter well suppose we say sixteen hundred in round numbers now out of a voyage of sixteen hundred leagues we have completed sixteen as you say what then at the expense of a diagonal journey of no less than eightyfive leagues exactly we have been twenty days about it exactly twenty days now sixteen is the hundredth part of our contemplated expedition if we go on in this way we shall be two thousand days that is about five years and a half going down the professor folded his arms listened but did not speak without counting that if a vertical descent of sixteen leagues costs us a horizontal of eightyfive we shall have to go about eight thousand leagues to the southeast and we must therefore come out somewhere in the circumference long before we can hope to reach the centre bother your calculations cried my uncle in one of his old rages on what basis do they rest how do you know that this passage does not take us direct to the end we require moreover i have in my favor fortunately a precedent what i have undertaken to do another has done and he having succeeded why should i not be equally successful i hope indeed you will but still i suppose i may be allowed to you are allowed to hold your tongue cried professor hardwigg when you talk so unreasonably as this i saw at once that the old doctorial professor was still alive in my uncleand fearful to rouse his angry passions i dropped the unpleasant subject now then he explained consult the manometer what does that indicate a considerable amount of pressure very good you see then that by descending slowly and by gradually accustoming ourselves to the density of this lower atmosphere we shall not suffer well i suppose not except it may be a certain amount of pain in the ears was my rather grim reply that my dear boy is nothing and you will easily get rid of that source of discomfort by bringing the exterior air in communication with the air contained in your lungs perfectly said i for i had quite made up my mind in no wise to contradict my uncle i should fancy almost that i should experience a certain amount of satisfaction in making a plunge into this dense atmosphere have you taken note of how wonderfully sound is propagated of course i have there can be no doubt that a journey into the interior of the earth would be an excellent cure for deafness but then uncle i ventured mildly to observe this density will continue to increase yesaccording to a law which however is scarcely defined it is true that the intensity of weight will diminish just in proportion to the depth to which we go you know very well that it is on the surface of the earth that its action is most powerfully felt while on the contrary in the very centre of the earth bodies cease to have any weight at all i know that is the case but as we progress will not the atmosphere finally assume the density of water i know it when placed under the pressure of seven hundred and ten atmospheres cried my uncle with imperturbable gravity and when we are still lower down i asked with natural anxiety well lower down the density will become even greater then how shall we be able to make our way through this atmospheric fog well my worthy nephew we must ballast ourselves by filling our pockets with stones said professor hardwigg faith uncle you have an answer for everything was my only reply i began to feel that it was unwise of me to go any farther into the wide field of hypotheses for i should certainly have revived some difficulty or rather impossibility that would have enraged the professor it was evident nevertheless that the air under a pressure which might be multiplied by thousands of atmospheres would end by becoming perfectly solid and that then admitting our bodies resisted the pressure we should have to stop in spite of all the reasonings in the world facts overcome all arguments but i thought it best not to urge this argument my uncle would simply have quoted the example of saknussemm supposing the learned icelanders journey ever really to have taken placethere was one simple answer to be made in the sixteenth century neither the barometer nor the manometer had been inventedhow then could saknussemm have been able to discover when he did reach the centre of the earth this unanswerable and learned objection i however kept to myself and bracing up my courage awaited the course of eventslittle aware of how adventurous yet were to be the incidents of our remarkable journey the rest of this day of leisure and repose was spent in calculation and conversation i made it a point to agree with the professor in everything but i envied the perfect indifference of hans who without taking any such trouble about the cause and effect went blindly onwards wherever destiny chose to lead him chapter 23 alone it must in all truth be confessed things as yet had gone on well and i should have acted in bad taste to have complained if the true medium of our difficulties did not increase it was within the range of possibility that we might ultimately reach the end of our journey then what glory would be ours i began in the newly aroused ardor of my soul to speak enthusiastically to the professor well was i serious the whole state in which we existed was a mysteryand it was impossible to know whether or not i was in earnest for several days after our memorable halt the slopes became more rapidsome were even of a most frightful characteralmost vertical so that we were forever going down into the solid interior mass during some days we actually descended a league and a half even two leagues towards the centre of the earth the descents were sufficiently perilous and while we were engaged in them we learned fully to appreciate the marvelous coolness of our guide hans without him we should have been wholly lost the grave and impassible icelander devoted himself to us with the most incomprehensible sangfroid and ease and thanks to him many a dangerous pass was got over where but for him we should inevitably have stuck fast his silence increased every day i think that we began to be influenced by this peculiar trait in his character it is certain that the inanimate objects by which you are surrounded have a direct action on the brain it must be that a man who shuts himself up between four walls must lose the faculty of associating ideas and words how many persons condemned to the horrors of solitary confinement have gone madsimply because the thinking faculties have lain dormant during the two weeks that followed our last interesting conversation there occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded i have while writing these memoirs taxed my memory in vain for one incident of travel during this particular period but the next event to be related is terrible indeed its very memory even now makes my soul shudder and my blood run cold it was on the seventh of august our constant and successive descents had taken us quite thirty leagues into the interior of the earth that is to say that there were above us thirty leagues nearly a hundred miles of rocks and oceans and continents and towns to say nothing of living inhabitants we were in a southeasterly direction about two hundred leagues from iceland on that memorable day the tunnel had begun to assume an almost horizontal course i was on this occasion walking on in front my uncle had charge of one of the ruhmkorff coils i had possession of the other by means of its light i was busy examining the different layers of granite i was completely absorbed in my work suddenly halting and turning round i found that i was alone well thought i to myself i have certainly been walking too fastor else hans and my uncle have stopped to rest the best thing i can do is to go back and find them luckily there is very little ascent to tire me i accordingly retraced my steps and while doing so walked for at least a quarter of an hour rather uneasy i paused and looked eagerly around not a living soul i called aloud no reply my voice was lost amid the myriad cavernous echoes it aroused i began for the first time to feel seriously uneasy a cold shiver shook my whole body and perspiration chill and terrible burst upon my skin i must be calm i said speaking aloud as boys whistle to drive away fear there can be no doubt that i shall find my companions there cannot be two roads it is certain that i was considerably ahead all i have to do is to go back having come to this determination i ascended the tunnel for at least half an hour unable to decide if i had ever seen certain landmarks before every now and then i paused to discover if any loud appeal was made to me well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere i should hear it a long way off but no the most extraordinary silence reigned in this immense gallery only the echoes of my own footsteps could be heard at last i stopped i could scarcely realize the fact of my isolation i was quite willing to think that i had made a mistake but not that i was lost if i had made a mistake i might find my way if losti shuddered to think of it come come said i to myself since there is only one road and they must come by it we shall at last meet all i have to do is still to go upwards perhaps however not seeing me and forgetting i was ahead they may have gone back in search of me still even in this case if i make haste i shall get up to them there can be no doubt about the matter but as i spoke these last words aloud it would have been quite clear to any listenerhad there been onethat i was by no means convinced of the fact moreover in order to associate together these simple ideas and to reunite them under the form of reasoning required some time i could not all at once bring my brain to think then another dread doubt fell upon my soul after all was i ahead of course i was hans was no doubt following behind preceded by my uncle i perfectly recollected his having stopped for a moment to strap his baggage on his shoulder i now remembered this trifling detail it was i believe just at that very moment that i had determined to continue my route again thought i reasoning as calmly as was possible there is another sure means of not losing my way a thread to guide me through the labyrinthine subterraneous retreatone which i had forgottenmy faithful river this course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits and i resolved to resume my journey without further delay no time was to be lost it was at this moment that i had reason to bless the thoughtfulness of my uncle when he refused to allow the eider hunter to close the orifices of the hot springthat small fissure in the great mass of granite this beneficent spring after having saved us from thirst during so many days would now enable me to regain the right road having come to this mental decision i made up my mind before i started upwards that ablution would certainly do me a great deal of good i stopped to plunge my hands and forehead in the pleasant water of the hansbach stream blessing its presence as a certain consolation conceive my horror and stupefactioni was treading a hard dusty shingly road of granite the stream on which i reckoned had wholly disappeared chapter 24 lost no words in any human language can depict my utter despair i was literally buried alive with no other expectation before me but to die in all the slow horrible torture of hunger and thirst mechanically i crawled about feeling the dry and arid rock never to my fancy had i ever felt anything so dry but i frantically asked myself how had i lost the course of the flowing stream there could be no doubt it had ceased to flow in the gallery in which i now was now i began to understand the cause of the strange silence which prevailed when last i tried if any appeal from my companions might perchance reach my ear it so happened that when i first took an imprudent step in the wrong direction i did not perceive the absence of the allimportant stream it was now quite evident that when we halted another tunnel must have received the waters of the little torrent and that i had unconsciously entered a different gallery to what unknown depths had my companions gone where was i how to get back clue or landmark there was absolutely none my feet left no signs on the granite and shingle my brain throbbed with agony as i tried to discover the solution of this terrible problem my situation after all sophistry and reflection had finally to be summed up in three awful words ilosti lost lost lost at a depth which to my finite understanding appeared to be immeasurable these thirty leagues of the crust of the earth weighed upon my shoulders like the globe on the shoulders of atlas i felt myself crushed by the awful weight it was indeed a position to drive the sanest man to madness i tried to bring my thoughts back to the things of the world so long forgotten it was with the greatest difficulty that i succeeded in doing so hamburg the house on the konigstrasse my dear cousin gretchenall that world which had before vanished like a shadow floated before my now vivid imagination there they were before me but how unreal under the influence of a terrible hallucination i saw all the incidents of our journey pass before me like the scenes of a panorama the ship and its inmates iceland m fridriksson and the great summit of mount sneffels i said to myself that if in my position i retained the most faint and shadowy outline of a hope it would be a sure sign of approaching delirium it were better to give way wholly to despair in fact did i but reason with calmness and philosophy what human power was there in existence able to take me back to the surface of the earth and ready too to split asunder to rend in twain those huge and mighty vaults which stand above my head who could enable me to find my roadand regain my companions insensate folly and madness to entertain even a shadow of hope oh uncle was my despairing cry this was the only word of reproach which came to my lips for i thoroughly understood how deeply and sorrowfully the worthy professor would regret my loss and how in his turn he would patiently seek for me when i at last began to resign myself to the fact that no further aid was to be expected from man and knowing that i was utterly powerless to do anything for my own salvation i kneeled with earnest fervor and asked assistance from heaven the remembrance of my innocent childhood the memory of my mother known only in my infancy came welling forth from my heart i had recourse to prayer and little as i had a right to be remembered by him whom i had forgotten in the hour of prosperity and whom i so tardily invoked i prayed earnestly and sincerely this renewal of my youthful faith brought about a much greater amount of calm and i was enabled to concentrate all my strength and intelligence on the terrible realities of my unprecedented situation i had about me that which i had at first wholly forgottenthree days provisions moreover my water bottle was quite full nevertheless the one thing which it was impossible to do was to remain alone try to find my companions i must at any price but which course should i take should i go upwards or again descend doubtless it was right to retrace my steps in an upward direction by doing this with care and coolness i must reach the point where i had turned away from the rippling stream i must find the fatal bifurcation or fork once at this spot once the river at my feet i could at all events regain the awful crater of mount sneffels why had i not thought of this before this at last was a reasonable hope of safety the most important thing then to be done was to discover the bed of the hansbach after a slight meal and a draught of water i rose like a giant refreshed leaning heavily on my pole i began the ascent of the gallery the slope was very rapid and rather difficult but i advanced hopefully and carefully like a man who at last is making his way out of a forest and knows there is only one road to follow during one whole hour nothing happened to check my progress as i advanced i tried to recollect the shape of the tunnelto recall to my memory certain projections of rocksto persuade myself that i had followed certain winding routes before but no one particular sign could i bring to mind and i was soon forced to allow that this gallery would never take me back to the point at which i had separated myself from my companions it was absolutely without issuea mere blind alley in the earth the moment at length came when facing the solid rock i knew my fate and fell inanimate on the arid floor to describe the horrible state of despair and fear into which i then fell would now be vain and impossible my last hope the courage which had sustained me drooped before the sight of this pitiless granite rock lost in a vast labyrinth the sinuosities of which spread in every direction without guide clue or compass i knew it was a vain and useless task to attempt flight all that remained to me was to lie down and die to lie down and die the most cruel and horrible of deaths in my state of mind the idea came into my head that one day perhaps when my fossil bones were found their discovery so far below the level of the earth might give rise to solemn and interesting scientific discussions i tried to cry aloud but hoarse hollow and inarticulate sounds alone could make themselves heard through my parched lips i literally panted for breath in the midst of all these horrible sources of anguish and despair a new horror took possession of my soul my lamp by falling down had got out of order i had no means of repairing it its light was already becoming paler and paler and soon would expire with a strange sense of resignation and despair i watched the luminous current in the coil getting less and less a procession of shadows moved flashing along the granite wall i scarcely dared to lower my eyelids fearing to lose the last spark of this fugitive light every instant it seemed to me that it was about to vanish and to leave me foreverin utter darkness at last one final trembling flame remained in the lamp i followed it with all my power of vision i gasped for breath i concentrated upon it all the power of my soul as upon the last scintillation of light i was ever destined to see and then i was to be lost forever in cimmerian and tenebrous shades a wild and plaintive cry escaped my lips on earth during the most profound and comparatively complete darkness light never allows a complete destruction and extinction of its power light is so diffuse so subtle that it permeates everywhere and whatever little may remain the retina of the eye will succeed in finding it in this place nothingthe absolute obscurity made me blind in every sense my head was now wholly lost i raised my arms trying the effects of the feeling in getting against the cold stone wall it was painful in the extreme madness must have taken possession of me i knew not what i did i began to run to fly rushing at haphazard in this inextricable labyrinth always going downwards running wildly underneath the terrestrial crust like an inhabitant of the subterranean furnaces screaming roaring howling until bruised by the pointed rocks falling and picking myself up all covered with blood seeking madly to drink the blood which dripped from my torn features mad because this blood only trickled over my face and watching always for this horrid wall which ever presented to me the fearful obstacle against which i could not dash my head where was i going it was impossible to say i was perfectly ignorant of the matter several hours passed in this way after a long time having utterly exhausted my strength i fell a heavy inert mass along the side of the tunnel and lost consciousness chapter 25 the whispering gallery when at last i came back to a sense of life and being my face was wet but wet as i soon knew with tears how long this state of insensibility lasted it is quite impossible for me now to say i had no means left to me of taking any account of time never since the creation of the world had such a solitude as mine existed i was completely abandoned after my fall i lost much blood i felt myself flooded with the lifegiving liquid my first sensation was perhaps a natural one why was i not dead because i was alive there was something left to do i tried to make up my mind to think no longer as far as i was able i drove away all ideas and utterly overcome by pain and grief i crouched against the granite wall i just commenced to feel the fainting coming on again and the sensation that this was the last struggle before complete annihilationwhen on a sudden a violent uproar reached my ears it had some resemblance to the prolonged rumbling voice of thunder and i clearly distinguished sonorous voices lost one after the other in the distant depths of the gulf whence came this noise naturally it was to be supposed from new phenomena which were taking place in the bosom of the solid mass of mother earth the explosion of some gaseous vapors or the fall of some solid of the granitic or other rock again i listened with deep attention i was extremely anxious to hear if this strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed a whole quarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation deep and solemn silence reigned in the tunnel so still that i could hear the beatings of my own heart i waited waited with a strange kind of hopefulness suddenly my ear which leaned accidentally against the wall appeared to catch as it were the faintest echo of a sound i thought that i heard vague incoherent and distant voices i quivered all over with excitement and hope it must be hallucination i cried it cannot be it is not true but no by listening more attentively i really did convince myself that what i heard was truly the sound of human voices to make any meaning out of the sound however was beyond my power i was too weak even to hear distinctly still it was a positive fact that someone was speaking of that i was quite certain there was a moment of fear a dread fell upon my soul that it might be my own words brought back to me by a distant echo perhaps without knowing it i might have been crying aloud i resolutely closed my lips and once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall yes for certain it was in truth the sound of human voices i now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the sides of the cavern until i reached a point where i could hear more distinctly but though i could detect the sound i could only make out uncertain strange and incomprehensible words they reached my ear as if they had been spoken in a low tonemurmured as it were afar off at last i made out the word forlorad repeated several times in a tone betokening great mental anguish and sorrow what could this word mean and who was speaking it it must be either my uncle or the guide hans if therefore i could hear them they must surely be able to hear me help i cried at the top of my voice help i am dying i then listened with scarcely a breath i panted for the slightest sound in the darknessa cry a sigh a question but silence reigned supreme no answer came in this way some minutes passed a whole flood of ideas flashed through my mind i began to fear that my voice weakened by sickness and suffering could not reach my companions who were in search of me it must be they i cried who else could by any possibility be buried a hundred miles below the level of the earth the mere supposition was preposterous i began therefore to listen again with the most breathless attention as i moved my ears along the side of the place i was in i found a mathematical point as it were where the voices appeared to attain their maximum of intensity the word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear then came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me out of torpor i begin to understand i said to myself after some little time devoted to reflection it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches my ears the walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite and the most fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them the sound must come along the gallery itself the place i was in must possess some peculiar acoustic properties of its own again i listened and this timeyes this timei heard my name distinctly pronounced cast as it were into space it was my uncle the professor who was speaking he was in conversation with the guide and the word which had so often reached my ears forlorad was a danish expression then i understood it all in order to make myself heard i too must speak as it were along the side of the gallery which would carry the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point to point but there was no time to lose if my companions were only to remove a few feet from where they stood the acoustic effect would be over my whispering gallery would be destroyed i again therefore crawled towards the wall and said as clearly and distinctly as i could uncle hardwigg i then awaited a reply sound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme rapidity besides the density of the air at that depth from light and motion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation several seconds elapsed which to my excited imagination appeared ages and these words reached my eager ears and moved my wildly beating heart harry my boy is that you a short delay between question and answer yesyes where are you lost and your lamp out but the guiding stream is lost keep your courage harry we will do our best one moment my uncle i cried i have no longer strength to answer your questions butfor heavens sakedo youcontinueto speakto me absolute silence i felt would be annihilation keep up your courage said my uncle as you are so weak do not speak we have been searching for you in all directions both by going upwards and downwards in the gallery my dear boy i had begun to give over all hopeand you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and regret i have shed at last supposing you to be still on the road beside the hansbach we again descended firing off guns as signals now however that we have found you and that our voices reach each other it may be a long time before we actually meet we are conversing by means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of the labyrinth but do not despair my dear boy it is something gained even to hear each other while he was speaking my brain was at work reflecting a certain undefined hope vague and shapeless as yet made my heart beat wildly in the first place it was absolutely necessary for me to know one thing i once more therefore leaned my head against the wall which i almost touched with my lips and again spoke uncle my boy was his answer after a few moments it is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are asunder that is not difficult you have your chronometer at hand i asked certainly well take it into your hand pronounce my name noting exactly the second at which you speak i will reply as soon as i hear your wordsand you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply reaches you very good and the mean time between my question and your answer will be the time occupied by my voice in reaching you that is exactly what i mean uncle was my eager reply are you ready yes well make ready i am about to pronounce your name said the professor i applied my ear close to the sides of the cavernous gallery and as soon as the word harry reached my ear i turned round and placing my lips to the wall repeated the sound forty seconds said my uncle there has elapsed forty seconds between the two words the sound therefore takes twenty seconds to ascend now allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every secondwe have twenty thousand four hundred feeta league and a half and oneeighth these words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell a league and a half i muttered in a low and despairing voice it shall be got over my boy cried my uncle in a cheery tone depend on us but do you know whether to ascend or descend i asked faintly enough we have to descend and i will tell you why you have reached a vast open space a kind of bare crossroad from which galleries diverge in every direction that in which you are now lying must necessarily bring you to this point for it appears that all these mighty fissures these fractures of the globes interior radiate from the vast cavern which we at this moment occupy rouse yourself then have courage and continue your route walk if you can if not drag yourself alongslide if nothing else is possible the slope must be rather rapidand you will find strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey make a start like a good fellow these words served to rouse some kind of courage in my sinking frame farewell for the present good uncle i am about to take my departure as soon as i start our voices will cease to commingle farewell then until we meet again adieu harryuntil we say welcome such were the last words which reached my anxious ears before i commenced my weary and almost hopeless journey this wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the vast mass of the earths labyrinth these words exchanged the speakers being about five miles apartended with hopeful and pleasant expressions i breathed one more prayer to heaven i sent up words of thanksgivingbelieving in my inmost heart that he had led me to the only place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears this apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by simple natural laws it arose from the conductibility of the rock there are many instances of this singular propagation of sound which are not perceptible in its less mediate positions in the interior gallery of st pauls and amid the curious caverns in sicily these phenomena are observable the most marvelous of them all is known as the ear of dionysius these memories of the past of my early reading and studies came fresh to my thoughts moreover i began to reason that if my uncle and i could communicate at so great a distance no serious obstacle could exist between us all i had to do was to follow the direction whence the sound had reached me and logically putting it i must reach him if my strength did not fail i accordingly rose to my feet i soon found however that i could not walk that i must drag myself along the slope as i expected was very rapid but i allowed myself to slip down soon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions and menaced a fearful fall i clutched at the sides i grasped at projections of rocks i threw myself backwards all in vain my weakness was so great i could do nothing to save myself suddenly earth failed me i was first launched into a dark and gloomy void i then struck against the projecting asperities of a vertical gallery a perfect well my head bounded against a pointed rock and i lost all knowledge of existence as far as i was concerned death had claimed me for his own chapter 26 a rapid recovery when i returned to the consciousness of existence i found myself surrounded by a kind of semiobscurity lying on some thick and soft coverlets my uncle was watchinghis eyes fixed intently on my countenance a grave expression on his face a tear in his eye at the first sigh which struggled from my bosom he took hold of my hand when he saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his he uttered a loud cry of joy he lives he lives yes my good uncle i whispered my dear boy continued the grim professor clasping me to his heart you are saved i was deeply and unaffectedly touched by the tone in which these words were uttered and even more by the kindly care which accompanied them the professor however was one of those men who must be severely tried in order to induce any display of affection or gentle emotion at this moment our friend hans the guide joined us he saw my hand in that of my uncle and i venture to say that taciturn as he was his eyes beamed with lively satisfaction god dag he said good day hans good day i replied in as hearty a tone as i could assume and now uncle that we are together tell me where we are i have lost all idea of our position as of everything else tomorrow harry tomorrow he replied today you are far too weak your head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be touched sleep my boy sleep and tomorrow you will know all that you require but i cried let me know what oclock it iswhat day it is it is now eleven oclock at night and this is once more sunday it is now the ninth of the month of august and i distinctly prohibit you from asking any more questions until the tenth of the same i was if the truth were told very weak indeed and my eyes soon closed involuntarily i did require a good nights rest and i went off reflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the interior of the earth in total darkness had lasted four days on the morning of the next day at my awakening i began to look around me my sleeping place made of all our traveling bedding was in a charming grotto adorned with magnificent stalagmites glittering in all the colors of the rainbow the floor of soft and silvery sand a dim obscurity prevailed no torch no lamp was lighted and yet certain unexplained beams of light penetrated from without and made their way through the opening of the beautiful grotto i moreover heard a vague and indefinite murmur like the ebb and flow of waves upon a strand and sometimes i verily believed i could hear the sighing of the wind i began to believe that instead of being awake i must be dreaming surely my brain had not been affected by my fall and all that occurred during the last twentyfour hours was not the frenzied visions of madness and yet after some reflection a trial of my faculties i came to the conclusion that i could not be mistaken eyes and ears could not surely both deceive me it is a ray of the blessed daylight i said to myself which has penetrated through some mighty fissure in the rocks but what is the meaning of this murmur of waves this unmistakable moaning of the saltsea billows i can hear too plainly enough the whistling of the wind but can i be altogether mistaken if my uncle during my illness has but carried me back to the surface of the earth has he on my account given up his wondrous expedition or in some strange manner has it come to an end i was puzzling my brain over these and other questions when the professor joined me good day harry he cried in a joyous tone i fancy you are quite well i am very much better i replied actually sitting up in my bed i knew that would be the end of it as you slept both soundly and tranquilly hans and i have each taken turn to watch and every hour we have seen visible signs of amelioration you must be right uncle was my reply for i feel as if i could do justice to any meal you could put before me you shall eat my boy you shall eat the fever has left you our excellent friend hans has rubbed your wounds and bruises with i know not what ointment of which the icelanders alone possess the secret and they have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner ah hes a wise fellow is master hans while he was speaking my uncle was placing before me several articles of food which despite his earnest injunctions i readily devoured as soon as the first rage of hunger was appeased i overwhelmed him with questions to which he now no longer hesitated to give answers i then learned for the first time that my providential fall had brought me to the bottom of an almost perpendicular gallery as i came down amidst a perfect shower of stones the least of which falling on me would have crushed me to death they came to the conclusion that i had carried with me an entire dislocated rock riding as it were on this terrible chariot i was cast headlong into my uncles arms and into them i fell insensible and covered with blood it is indeed a miracle was the professors final remark that you were not killed a thousand times over but let us take care never to separate for surely we should risk never meeting again let us take care never again to separate these words fell with a sort of chill upon my heart the journey then was not over i looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment my uncle after an instants examination of my countenance said what is the matter harry i want to ask you a very serious question you say that i am all right in health certainly you are and all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion i asked most undoubtedly but what about my head was my next anxious question well your head except that you have one or two contusions is exactly where it ought to beon your shoulders said my uncle laughing well my own opinion is that my head is not exactly right in fact i believe myself slightly delirious what makes you think so i will explain why i fancy i have lost my senses i cried have we not returned to the surface of mother earth certainly not then truly i must be mad for do i not see the light of day do i not hear the whistling of the wind and can i not distinguish the wash of a great sea and that is all that makes you uneasy said my uncle with a smile can you explain i will not make any attempt to explain for the whole matter is utterly inexplicable but you shall see and judge for yourself you will then find that geological science is as yet in its infancyand that we are doomed to enlighten the world let us advance then i cried eagerly no longer able to restrain my curiosity wait a moment my dear harry he responded you must take precautions after your illness before going into the open air the open air yes my boy i have to warn you that the wind is rather violentand i have no wish for you to expose yourself without necessary precautions but i beg to assure you that i am perfectly recovered from my illness have just a little patience my boy a relapse would be inconvenient to all parties we have no time to loseas our approaching sea voyage may be of long duration sea voyage i cried more bewildered than ever yes you must take another days rest and we shall be ready to go on board by tomorrow replied my uncle with a peculiar smile go on board the words utterly astonished me go on boardwhat and how had we come upon a river a lake had we discovered some inland sea was a vessel lying at anchor in some part of the interior of the earth my curiosity was worked up to the very highest pitch my uncle made vain attempts to restrain me when at last however he discovered that my feverish impatience would do more harm than goodand that the satisfaction of my wishes could alone restore me to a calm state of mindhe gave way i dressed myself rapidlyand then taking the precaution to please my uncle of wrapping myself in one of the coverlets i rushed out of the grotto chapter 27 the central sea at first i saw absolutely nothing my eyes wholly unused to the effulgence of light could not bear the sudden brightness and i was compelled to close them when i was able to reopen them i stood still far more stupefied than astonished not all the wildest effects of imagination could have conjured up such a scene the seathe sea i cried yes replied my uncle in a tone of pardonable pride the central sea no future navigator will deny the fact of my having discovered it and hence of acquiring a right of giving it a name it was quite true a vast limitless expanse of water the end of a lake if not of an ocean spread before us until it was lost in the distance the shore which was very much indented consisted of a beautiful soft golden sand mixed with small shells the longdeserted home of some of the creatures of a past age the waves broke incessantlyand with a peculiarly sonorous murmur to be found in underground localities a slight frothy flake arose as the wind blew along the pellucid waters and many a dash of spray was blown into my face the mighty superstructure of rock which rose above to an inconceivable height left only a narrow openingbut where we stood there was a large margin of strand on all sides were capes and promontories and enormous cliffs partially worn by the eternal breaking of the waves through countless ages and as i gazed from side to side the mighty rocks faded away like a fleecy film of cloud it was in reality an ocean with all the usual characteristics of an inland sea only horribly wildso rigid cold and savage one thing startled and puzzled me greatly how was it that i was able to look upon that vast sheet of water instead of being plunged in utter darkness the vast landscape before me was lit up like day but there was wanting the dazzling brilliancy the splendid irradiation of the sun the pale cold illumination of the moon the brightness of the stars the illuminating power in this subterranean region from its trembling and rickering character its clear dry whiteness the very slight elevation of its temperature its great superiority to that of the moon was evidently electric something in the nature of the aurora borealis only that its phenomena were constant and able to light up the whole of the ocean cavern the tremendous vault above our heads the sky so to speak appeared to be composed of a conglomeration of nebulous vapors in constant motion i should originally have supposed that under such an atmospheric pressure as must exist in that place the evaporation of water could not really take place and yet from the action of some physical law which escaped my memory there were heavy and dense clouds rolling along that mighty vault partially concealing the roof electric currents produced astonishing play of light and shade in the distance especially around the heavier clouds deep shadows were cast beneath and then suddenly between two clouds there would come a ray of unusual beauty and remarkable intensity and yet it was not like the sun for it gave no heat the effect was sad and excruciatingly melancholy instead of a noble firmament of blue studded with stars there was above me a heavy roof of granite which seemed to crush me gazing around i began to think of the theory of the english captain who compared the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the air is retained in a luminous state by means of atmospheric pressure while two stars pluto and proserpine circled there in their mysterious orbits after all suppose the old fellow was right in truth we were imprisonedbound as it were in a vast excavation its width it was impossible to make out the shore on either hand widening rapidly until lost to sight while its length was equally uncertain a haze on the distant horizon bounded our view as to its height we could see that it must be many miles to the roof looking upward it was impossible to discover where the stupendous roof began the lowest of the clouds must have been floating at an elevation of two thousand yards a height greater than that of terrestrial vapors which circumstance was doubtless owing to the extreme density of the air i use the word cavern in order to give an idea of the place i cannot describe its awful grandeur human language fails to convey an idea of its savage sublimity whether this singular vacuum had or had not been caused by the sudden cooling of the earth when in a state of fusion i could not say i had read of most wonderful and gigantic cavernsbut none in any way like this the great grotto of guachara in colombia visited by the learned humboldt the vast and partially explored mammoth cave in kentuckywhat were these holes in the earth to that in which i stood in speechless admiration with its vapory clouds its electric light and the mighty ocean slumbering in its bosom imagination not description can alone give an idea of the splendor and vastness of the cave i gazed at these marvels in profound silence words were utterly wanting to indicate the sensations of wonder i experienced i seemed as i stood upon that mysterious shore as if i were some wandering inhabitant of a distant planet present for the first time at the spectacle of some terrestrial phenomena belonging to another existence to give body and existence to such new sensations would have required the coinage of new wordsand here my feeble brain found itself wholly at fault i looked on i thought i reflected i admired in a state of stupefaction not altogether unmingled with fear the unexpected spectacle restored some color to my pallid cheeks i seemed to be actually getting better under the influence of this novelty moreover the vivacity of the dense atmosphere reanimated my body by inflating my lungs with unaccustomed oxygen it will be readily conceived that after an imprisonment of fortyseven days in a dark and miserable tunnel it was with infinite delight that i breathed this saline air it was like the genial reviving influence of the salt sea waves my uncle had already got over the first surprise with the latin poet horace his idea was that not to admire is all the art i know to make man happy and to keep him so well he said after giving me time thoroughly to appreciate the marvels of this underground sea do you feel strong enough to walk up and down certainly was my ready answer nothing would give me greater pleasure well then my boy he said lean on my arm and we will stroll along the beach i accepted his offer eagerly and we began to walk along the shores of this extraordinary lake to our left were abrupt rocks piled one upon the othera stupendous titanic pile down their sides leaped innumerable cascades which at last becoming limpid and murmuring streams were lost in the waters of the lake light vapors which rose here and there and floated in fleecy clouds from rock to rock indicated hot springs which also poured their superfluity into the vast reservoir at our feet among them i recognized our old and faithful stream the hansbach which lost in that wild basin seemed as if it had been flowing since the creation of the world we shall miss our excellent friend i remarked with a deep sigh bah said my uncle testily what matters it that or another it is all the same i thought the remark ungrateful and felt almost inclined to say so but i forbore at this moment my attention was attracted by an unexpected spectacle after we had gone about five hundred yards we suddenly turned a steep promontory and found ourselves close to a lofty forest it consisted of straight trunks with tufted tops in shape like parasols the air seemed to have no effect upon these treeswhich in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified i hastened forward i could find no name for these singular formations did they not belong to the two thousand and more known treesor were we to make the discovery of a new growth by no means when we at last reached the forest and stood beneath the trees my surprise gave way to admiration in truth i was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the earth of singular and gigantic proportions my uncle unhesitatingly called them by their real names it is only he said in his coolest manner a forest of mushrooms on close examination i found that he was not mistaken judge of the development attained by this product of damp hot soils i had heard that the lycoperdon giganteum reaches nine feet in circumference but here were white mushrooms nearly forty feet high and with tops of equal dimensions they grew in countless thousandsthe light could not make its way through their massive substance and beneath them reigned a gloomy and mystic darkness still i wished to go forward the cold in the shades of this singular forest was intense for nearly an hour we wandered about in this visible darkness at length i left the spot and once more returned to the shores of the lake to light and comparative warmth but the amazing vegetation of subterraneous land was not confined to gigantic mushrooms new wonders awaited us at every step we had not gone many hundred yards when we came upon a mighty group of other trees with discolored leavesthe common humble trees of mother earth of an exorbitant and phenomenal size lycopods a hundred feet high flowering ferns as tall as pines gigantic grasses astonishing magnificent splendid cried my uncle here we have before us the whole flora of the second period of the world that of transition behold the humble plants of our gardens which in the first ages of the world were mighty trees look around you my dear harry no botanist ever before gazed on such a sight my uncles enthusiasm always a little more than was required was now excusable you are right uncle i remarked providence appears to have designed the preservation in this vast and mysterious hothouse of antediluvian plants to prove the sagacity of learned men in figuring them so marvelously on paper well said my boyvery well said it is indeed a mighty hothouse but you would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense if you added that it is also a vast menagerie i looked rather anxiously around if the animals were as exaggerated as the plants the matter would certainly be serious a menagerie doubtless look at the dust we are treading under footbehold the bones with which the whole soil of the seashore is covered bones i replied yes certainly the bones of antediluvian animals i stooped down as i spoke and picked up one or two singular remains relics of a bygone age it was easy to give a name to these gigantic bones in some instances as big as trunks of trees here is clearly the lower jawbone of a mastodon i cried almost as warmly and enthusiastically as my uncle here are the molars of the dinotherium here is a leg bone which belonged to the megatherium you are right uncle it is indeed a menagerie for the mighty animals to which these bones once belonged have lived and died on the shores of this subterranean sea under the shadow of these plants look yonder are whole skeletonsand yet and yet nephew said my uncle noticing that i suddenly came to a full stop i do not understand the presence of such beasts in granite caverns however vast and prodigious was my reply why not said my uncle with very much of his old professional impatience because it is well known that animal life only existed on earth during the secondary period when the sedimentary soil was formed by the alluviums and thus replaced the hot and burning rocks of the primitive age i have listened to you earnestly and with patience harry and i have a simple and clear answer to your objections and that is that this itself is a sedimentary soil how can that be at such enormous depth from the surface of the earth the fact can be explained both simply and geologically at a certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust liable to alternative upward and downward movements in virtue of the law of attraction it is very probable that many a landslip took place in those days and that large portions of sedimentary soil were cast into huge and mighty chasms quite possible i dryly remarked but uncle if these antediluvian animals formerly lived in these subterranean regions what more likely than that one of these monsters may at this moment be concealed behind one of yonder mighty rocks as i spoke i looked keenly around examining with care every point of the horizon but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted shores i now felt rather fatigued and told my uncle so the walk and excitement were too much for me in my weak state i therefore seated myself at the end of a promontory at the foot of which the waves broke in incessant rolls i looked round a bay formed by projections of vast granitic rocks at the extreme end was a little port protected by huge pyramids of stones a brig and three or four schooners might have lain there with perfect ease so natural did it seem that every minute my imagination induced me to expect a vessel coming out under all sail and making for the open sea under the influence of a warm southerly breeze but the fantastic illusion never lasted more than a minute we were the only living creatures in this subterranean world during certain periods there was an utter cessation of wind when a silence deeper more terrible than the silence of the desert fell upon these solitary and arid rocksand seemed to hang like a leaden weight upon the waters of this singular ocean i sought amid the awful stillness to penetrate through the distant fog to tear down the veil which concealed the mysterious distance what unspoken words were murmured by my trembling lipswhat questions did i wish to ask and did not where did this sea endto what did it lead should we ever be able to examine its distant shores but my uncle had no doubts about the matter he was convinced that our enterprise would in the end be successful for my part i was in a state of painful indecisioni desired to embark on the journey and to succeed and still i feared the result after we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the wondrous spectacle we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to the grotto which i was not sorry to gain after a slight repast i sought refuge in slumber and at length after many and tedious struggles sleep came over my weary eyes chapter 28 launching the raft on the morning of the next day to my great surprise i awoke completely restored i thought a bath would be delightful after my long illness and sufferings so soon after rising i went and plunged into the waters of this new mediterranean the bath was cool fresh and invigorating i came back to breakfast with an excellent appetite hans our worthy guide thoroughly understood how to cook such eatables as we were able to provide he had both fire and water at discretion so that he was enabled slightly to vary the weary monotony of our ordinary repast our morning meal was like a capital english breakfast with coffee by way of a windup and never had this delicious beverage been so welcome and refreshing my uncle had sufficient regard for my state of health not to interrupt me in the enjoyment of the meal but he was evidently delighted when i had finished now then said he come with me it is the height of the tide and i am anxious to study its curious phenomena what i cried rising in astonishment did you say the tide uncle certainly i did you do not mean to say i replied in a tone of respectful doubt that the influence of the sun and moon is felt here below and pray why not are not all bodies influenced by the law of universal attraction why should this vast underground sea be exempt from the general law the rule of the universe besides there is nothing like that which is proved and demonstrated despite the great atmospheric pressure down here you will notice that this inland sea rises and falls with as much regularity as the atlantic itself as my uncle spoke we reached the sandy shore and saw and heard the waves breaking monotonously on the beach they were evidently rising this is truly the flood i cried looking at the water at my feet yes my excellent nephew replied my uncle rubbing his hands with the gusto of a philosopher and you see by these several streaks of foam that the tide rises at least ten or twelve feet it is indeed marvelous by no means he responded on the contrary it is quite natural it may appear so in your eyes my dear uncle was my reply but all the phenomena of the place appear to me to partake of the marvelous it is almost impossible to believe that which i see who in his wildest dreams could have imagined that beneath the crust of our earth there could exist a real ocean with ebbing and flowing tides with its changes of winds and even its storms i for one should have laughed the suggestion to scorn but harry my boy why not inquired my uncle with a pitying smile is there any physical reason in opposition to it well if we give up the great theory of the central heat of the earth i certainly can offer no reasons why anything should be looked upon as impossible then you will own he added that the system of sir humphry davy is wholly justified by what we have seen i allow that it isand that point once granted i certainly can see no reason for doubting the existence of seas and other wonders even countries in the interior of the globe that is sobut of course these varied countries are uninhabited well i grant that it is more likely than not still i do not see why this sea should not have given shelter to some species of unknown fish hitherto we have not discovered any and the probabilities are rather against our ever doing so observed the professor i was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders well i am determined to solve the question it is my intention to try my luck with my fishing line and hook certainly make the experiment said my uncle pleased with my enthusiasm while we are about it it will certainly be only proper to discover all the secrets of this extraordinary region but after all where are we now i asked all this time i have quite forgotten to ask you a question which doubtless your philosophical instruments have long since answered well replied the professor examining the situation from only one point of view we are now distant three hundred and fifty leagues from iceland so much was my exclamation i have gone over the matter several times and am sure not to have made a mistake of five hundred yards replied my uncle positively and as to the directionare we still going to the southeast yes with a western declination2 of nineteen degrees fortytwo minutes just as it is above as for the inclination3 i have discovered a very curious fact 2 the declination is the variation of the needle from the true meridian of a place 3 inclination is the dip of the magnetic needle with a tendency to incline towards the earth what may that be uncle your information interests me why that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on earth in the northern hemisphere has an upward tendency this proves i cried that the great point of magnetic attraction lies somewhere between the surface of the earth and the spot we have succeeded in reaching exactly my observant nephew exclaimed my uncle elated and delighted and it is quite probable that if we succeed in getting toward the polar regionssomewhere near the seventythird degree of latitude where sir james ross discovered the magnetic pole we shall behold the needle point directly upward we have therefore discovered by analogy that this great centre of attraction is not situated at a very great depth well said i rather surprised this discovery will astonish experimental philosophers it was never suspected science great mighty and in the end unerring replied my uncle dogmatically science has fallen into many errorserrors which have been fortunate and useful rather than otherwise for they have been the steppingstones to truth after some further discussion i turned to another matter have you any idea of the depth we have reached we are now continued the professor exactly thirtyfive leaguesabove a hundred milesdown into the interior of the earth so said i after measuring the distance on the map we are now beneath the scottish highlands and have over our heads the lofty grampian hills you are quite right said the professor laughing it sounds very alarming the weight being heavybut the vault which supports this vast mass of earth and rock is solid and safe the mighty architect of the universe has constructed it of solid materials man even in his highest flights of vivid and poetic imagination never thought of such things what are the finest arches of our bridges what the vaulted roofs of our cathedrals to that mighty dome above us and beneath which floats an ocean with its storms and calms and tides i admire it all as much as you can uncle and have no fear that our granite sky will fall upon our heads but now that we have discussed matters of science and discovery what are your future intentions are you not thinking of getting back to the surface of our beautiful earth this was said more as a feeler than with any hope of success go back nephew cried my uncle in a tone of alarm you are not surely thinking of anything so absurd or cowardly no my intention is to advance and continue our journey we have as yet been singularly fortunate and henceforth i hope we shall be more so but said i how are we to cross yonder liquid plain it is not my intention to leap into it head foremost or even to swim across it like leander over the hellespont but as oceans are after all only great lakes inasmuch as they are surrounded by land so does it stand to reason that this central sea is circumscribed by granite surroundings doubtless was my natural reply well then do you not think that when once we reach the other end we shall find some means of continuing our journey probably but what extent do you allow to this internal ocean well i should fancy it to extend about forty or fifty leaguesmore or less but even supposing this approximation to be a correct onewhat then i asked my dear boy we have no time for further discussion we shall embark tomorrow i looked around with surprise and incredulity i could see nothing in the shape of boat or vessel what i cried we are about to launch out upon an unknown sea and where if i may ask is the vessel to carry us well my dear boy it will not be exactly what you would call a vessel for the present we must be content with a good and solid raft a raft i cried incredulously but down here a raft is as impossible of construction as a vesseland i am at a loss to imagine my good harryif you were to listen instead of talking so much you would hear said my uncle waxing a little impatient i should hear yescertain knocks with the hammer which hans is now employing to make the raft he has been at work for many hours making a raft yes but where has he found trees suitable for such a construction he found the trees all ready to his hand come and you shall see our excellent guide at work more and more amazed at what i heard and saw i followed my uncle like one in a dream after a walk of about a quarter of an hour i saw hans at work on the other side of the promontory which formed our natural port a few minutes more and i was beside him to my great surprise on the sandy shore lay a halffinished raft it was made from beams of a very peculiar wood and a great number of limbs joints boughs and pieces lay about sufficient to have constructed a fleet of ships and boats i turned to my uncle silent with astonishment and awe where did all this wood come from i cried what wood is it well there is pinewood fir and the palms of the northern regions mineralized by the action of the sea he replied sententiously can it be possible yes said the learned professor what you see is called fossil wood but then cried i after reflecting for a moment like the lignites it must be as hard and as heavy as iron and therefore will certainly not float sometimes that is the case many of these woods have become true anthracites but others again like those you see before you have only undergone one phase of fossil transformation but there is no proof like demonstration added my uncle picking one or two of these precious waifs and casting them into the sea the piece of wood after having disappeared for a moment came to the surface and floated about with the oscillation produced by wind and tide are you convinced said my uncle with a selfsatisfied smile i am convinced i cried that what i see is incredible the fact was that my journey into the interior of the earth was rapidly changing all preconceived notions and day by day preparing me for the marvelous i should not have been surprised to have seen a fleet of native canoes afloat upon that silent sea the very next evening thanks to the industry and ability of hans the raft was finished it was about ten feet long and five feet wide the beams bound together with stout ropes were solid and firm and once launched by our united efforts the improvised vessel floated tranquilly upon the waters of what the professor had well named the central sea chapter 29 on the watersa raft voyage on the thirteenth of august we were up betimes there was no time to be lost we now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion which would have the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing a mast made of two pieces of wood fastened together to give additional strength a yard made from another one the sail a linen sheet from our bed we were fortunately in no want of cordage and the whole on trial appeared solid and seaworthy at six oclock in the morning when the eager and enthusiastic professor gave the signal to embark the victuals the luggage all our instruments our weapons and a goodly supply of sweet water which we had collected from springs in the rocks were placed on the raft hans had with considerable ingenuity contrived a rudder which enabled him to guide the floating apparatus with ease he took the tiller as a matter of course the worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide and duck hunter i then let go the painter which held us to the shore the sail was brought to the wind and we made a rapid offing our sea voyage had at length commenced and once more we were making for distant and unknown regions just as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been constructed my uncle who was very strong as to geographic nomenclature wanted to give it a name and among others suggested mine well said i before you decide i have another to propose well out with it i should like to call it gretchen port gretchen will sound very well on our future map well then port gretchen let it be said the professor and thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our adventurous and memorable expedition when we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and eastward we went directly before the wind at a much greater speed than might have been expected from a raft the dense layers of atmosphere at that depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with considerable force at the end of an hour my uncle who had been taking careful observations was enabled to judge of the rapidity with which we moved it was far beyond anything seen in the upper world if he said we continue to advance at our present rate we shall have traveled at least thirty leagues in twentyfour hours with a mere raft this is an almost incredible velocity i certainly was surprised and without making any reply went forward upon the raft already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of the horizon the two shores appeared to separate more and more leaving a wide and open space for our departure before me i could see nothing but the vast and apparently limitless seaupon which we floatedthe only living objects in sight huge and dark clouds cast their grey shadows belowshadows which seemed to crush that colorless and sullen water by their weight anything more suggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness i never beheld silvery rays of electric light reflected here and there upon some small spots of water brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our cumbrous bark presently we were wholly out of sight of land not a vestige could be seen nor any indication of where we were going so still and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our eyes on that but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft i should have fancied that we were still and motionless but i knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate about twelve oclock in the day vast collections of seaweed were discovered surrounding us on all sides i was aware of the extraordinary vegetative power of these plants which have been known to creep along the bottom of the great ocean and stop the advance of large ships but never were seaweeds ever seen so gigantic and wonderful as those of the central sea i could well imagine how seen at a distance tossing and heaving on the summit of the billows the long lines of algae have been taken for living things and thus have been fertile sources of the belief in sea serpents our raft swept past great specimens of fucus or seawrack from three to four thousand feet in length immense incredibly long looking like snakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon it afforded me great amusement to gaze on their variegated ribbonlike endless lengths hour after hour passed without our coming to the termination of these floating weeds if my astonishment increased my patience was wellnigh exhausted what natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and extraordinary plants what must have been the aspect of the globe during the first centuries of its formation when under the combined action of heat and humidity the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast surface to the exclusion of everything else these were considerations of neverending interest for the geologist and the philosopher all this while we were advancing on our journey and at length night came but as i had remarked the evening before the luminous state of the atmosphere was in nothing diminished whatever was the cause it was a phenomenon upon the duration of which we could calculate with certainty as soon as our supper had been disposed of and some little speculative conversation indulged in i stretched myself at the foot of the mast and presently went to sleep hans remained motionless at the tiller allowing the raft to rise and fall on the waves the wind being aft and the sail square all he had to do was to keep his oar in the centre ever since we had taken our departure from the newly named port gretchen my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our days navigation with instructions to put down even the most minute particulars every interesting and curious phenomenon the direction of the wind our rate of sailing the distance we went in a word every incident of our extraordinary voyage from our log therefore i tell the story of our voyage on the central sea friday august 14th a steady breeze from the northwest raft progressing with extreme rapidity and going perfectly straight coast still dimly visible about thirty leagues to leeward nothing to be seen beyond the horizon in front the extraordinary intensity of the light neither increases nor diminishes it is singularly stationary the weather remarkably fine that is to say the clouds have ascended very high and are light and fleecy and surrounded by an atmosphere resembling silver in fusion thermometer 32 degrees centigrade about twelve oclock in the day our guide hans having prepared and baited a hook cast his line into the subterranean waters the bait he used was a small piece of meat by means of which he concealed his hook anxious as i was i was for a long time doomed to disappointment were these waters supplied with fish or not that was the important question nowas my decided answer then there came a sudden and rather hard tug hans coolly drew it in and with it a fish which struggled violently to escape a fish cried my uncle it is a sturgeon i cried certainly a small sturgeon the professor examined the fish carefully noting every characteristic and he did not coincide in my opinion the fish had a flat head round body and the lower extremities covered with bony scales its mouth was wholly without teeth the pectoral fins which were highly developed sprouted direct from the body which properly speaking had no tail the animal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the sturgeon but it differed from that fish in many essential particulars my uncle after all was not mistaken after a long and patient examination he said this fish my dear boy belongs to a family which has been extinct for ages and of which no trace has ever been found on earth except fossil remains in the devonian strata you do not mean to say i cried that we have captured a live specimen of a fish belonging to the primitive stock that existed before the deluge we have said the professor who all this time was continuing his observations and you may see by careful examination that these fossil fish have no identity with existing species to hold in ones hand therefore a living specimen of the order is enough to make a naturalist happy for life but cried i to what family does it belong to the order of ganoidesan order of fish having angular scales covered with bright enamelforming one of the family of the cephalaspides of the genus well sir i remarked as i noticed my uncle hesitated to conclude to the genus pterychtisyes i am certain of it still though i am confident of the correctness of my surmise this fish offers to our notice a remarkable peculiarity never known to exist in any other fish but those which are the natives of subterranean waters wells lakes in caverns and suchlike hidden pools and what may that be it is blind blind i cried much surprised not only blind continued the professor but absolutely without organs of sight i now examined our discovery for myself it was singular to be sure but it was really a fact this however might be a solitary instance i suggested the hook was baited again and once more thrown into the water this subterranean ocean must have been tolerably well supplied with fish for in two hours we took a large number of pterychtis as well as other fish belonging to another supposed extinct familythe dipterides a genus of fish furnished with two fins only whence the name though my uncle could not class it exactly all without exception however were blind this unexpected capture enabled us to renew our stock of provisions in a very satisfactory way we were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish known to us as fossil specimensand fish and reptiles alike were all the more perfect the farther back they dated their origin we began to hope that we should find some of those saurians which science has succeeded in reconstructing from bits of bone or cartilage i took up the telescope and carefully examined the horizonlooked over the whole sea it was utterly and entirely deserted doubtless we were still too near the coast after an examination of the ocean i looked upward towards the strange and mysterious sky why should not one of the birds reconstructed by the immortal cuvier flap his stupendous wings aloft in the dull strata of subterranean air it would of course find quite sufficient food from the fish in the sea i gazed for some time upon the void above it was as silent and as deserted as the shores we had but lately left nevertheless though i could neither see nor discover anything my imagination carried me away into wild hypotheses i was in a kind of waking dream i thought i saw on the surface of the water those enormous antediluvian turtles as big as floating islands upon those dull and somber shores passed a spectral row of the mammifers of early days the great liptotherium found in the cavernous hollow of the brazilian hills the mesicotherium a native of the glacial regions of siberia farther on the pachydermatous lophrodon that gigantic tapir which concealed itself behind rocks ready to do battle for its prey with the anoplotherium a singular animal partaking of the nature of the rhinoceros the horse the hippopotamus and the camel there was the giant mastodon twisting and turning his horrid trunk with which he crushed the rocks of the shore to powder while the megatheriumhis back raised like a cat in a passion his enormous claws stretched out dug into the earth for food at the same time that he awoke the sonorous echoes of the whole place with his terrible roar higher up still the first monkey ever seen on the face of the globe clambered gamboling and playing up the granite hills still farther away ran the pterodactyl with the winged hand gliding or rather sailing through the dense and compressed air like a huge bat above all near the leaden granitic sky were immense birds more powerful than the cassowary and the ostrich which spread their mighty wings and fluttered against the huge stone vault of the inland sea i thought such was the effect of my imagination that i saw this whole tribe of antediluvian creatures i carried myself back to far ages long before man existedwhen in fact the earth was in too imperfect a state for him to live upon it my dream was of countless ages before the existence of man the mammifers first disappeared then the mighty birds then the reptiles of the secondary period presently the fish the crustacea the mollusks and finally the vertebrata the zoophytes of the period of transition in their turn sank into annihilation the whole panorama of the worlds life before the historic period seemed to be born over again and mine was the only human heart that beat in this unpeopled world there were no more seasons there were no more climates the natural heat of the world increased unceasingly and neutralized that of the great radiant sun vegetation was exaggerated in an extraordinary manner i passed like a shadow in the midst of brushwood as lofty as the giant trees of california and trod underfoot the moist and humid soil reeking with a rank and varied vegetation i leaned against the huge columnlike trunks of giant trees to which those of canada were as ferns whole ages passed hundreds upon hundreds of years were concentrated into a single day next unrolled before me like a panorama came the great and wondrous series of terrestrial transformations plants disappeared the granitic rocks lost all trace of solidity the liquid state was suddenly substituted for that which had before existed this was caused by intense heat acting on the organic matter of the earth the waters flowed over the whole surface of the globe they boiled they were volatilized or turned into vapor a kind of steam cloud wrapped the whole earth the globe itself becoming at last nothing but one huge sphere of gas indescribable in color between white heat and red as big and as brilliant as the sun in the very centre of this prodigious mass fourteen hundred thousand times as large as our globe i was whirled round in space and brought into close conjunction with the planets my body was subtilized or rather became volatile and commingled in a state of atomic vapor with the prodigious clouds which rushed forward like a mighty comet into infinite space what an extraordinary dream where would it finally take me my feverish hand began to write down the marvelous detailsdetails more like the imaginings of a lunatic than anything sober and real i had during this period of hallucination forgotten everythingthe professor the guide and the raft on which we were floating my mind was in a state of semioblivion what is the matter harry said my uncle suddenly my eyes which were wide opened like those of a somnambulist were fixed upon him but i did not see him nor could i clearly make out anything around me take care my boy again cried my uncle you will fall into the sea as he uttered these words i felt myself seized on the other side by the firm hand of our devoted guide had it not been for the presence of mind of hans i must infallibly have fallen into the waves and been drowned have you gone mad cried my uncle shaking me on the other side whatwhat is the matter i said at last coming to myself are you ill henry continued the professor in an anxious tone nono but i have had an extraordinary dream it however has passed away all now seems well i added looking around me with strangely puzzled eyes all right said my uncle a beautiful breeze a splendid sea we are going along at a rapid rate and if i am not out in my calculations we shall soon see land i shall not be sorry to exchange the narrow limits of our raft for the mysterious strand of the subterranean ocean as my uncle uttered these words i rose and carefully scanned the horizon but the line of water was still confounded with the lowering clouds that hung aloft and in the distance appeared to touch the edge of the water chapter 30 terrific saurian combat saturday august 15th the sea still retains its uniform monotony the same leaden hue the same eternal glare from above no indication of land being in sight the horizon appears to retreat before us more and more as we advance my head still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary dream which i cannot as yet banish from my mind the professor who has not dreamed is however in one of his morose and unaccountable humors spends his time in scanning the horizon at every point of the compass his telescope is raised every moment to his eyes and when he finds nothing to give any clue to our whereabouts he assumes a napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously i remarked that my uncle the professor had a strong tendency to resume his old impatient character and i could not but make a note of this disagreeable circumstance in my journal i saw clearly that it had required all the influence of my danger and suffering to extract from him one scintillation of humane feeling now that i was quite recovered his original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand and after all what had he to be angry and annoyed about now more than at any other time was not the journey being accomplished under the most favorable circumstances was not the raft progressing with the most marvelous rapidity what then could be the matter after one or two preliminary hems i determined to inquire you seem uneasy uncle said i when for about the hundredth time he put down his telescope and walked up and down muttering to himself no i am not uneasy he replied in a dry harsh tone by no means perhaps i should have said impatient i replied softening the force of my remark enough to make me so i think and yet we are advancing at a rate seldom attained by a raft i remarked what matters that cried my uncle i am not vexed at the rate we go at but i am annoyed to find the sea so much vaster than i expected i then recollected that the professor before our departure had estimated the length of this subterranean ocean as at most about thirty leagues now we had traveled at least over thrice that distance without discovering any trace of the distant shore i began to understand my uncles anger we are not going down suddenly exclaimed the professor we are not progressing with our great discoveries all this is utter loss of time after all i did not come from home to undertake a party of pleasure this voyage on a raft over a pond annoys and wearies me he called this adventurous journey a party of pleasure and this great inland sea a pond but argued i if we have followed the route indicated by the great saknussemm we cannot be going far wrong that is the question as the great the immortal shakespeare has it are we following the route indicated by that wondrous sage did saknussemm ever fall in with this great sheet of water if he did did he cross it i begin to fear that the rivulet we adopted for a guide has led us wrong in any case we can never regret having come thus far it is worth the whole journey to have enjoyed this magnificent spectacleit is something to have seen i care nothing about seeing nor about magnificent spectacles i came down into the interior of the earth with an object and that object i mean to attain dont talk to me about admiring scenery or any other sentimental trash after this i thought it well to hold my tongue and allow the professor to bite his lips until the blood came without further remark at six oclock in the evening our matteroffact guide hans asked for his weeks salary and receiving his three rixdollars put them carefully in his pocket he was perfectly contented and satisfied sunday august 16th nothing new to record the same weather as before the wind has a slight tendency to freshen up with signs of an approaching gale when i awoke my first observation was in regard to the intensity of the light i keep on fearing day after day that the extraordinary electric phenomenon should become first obscured and then go wholly out leaving us in total darkness nothing however of the kind occurs the shadow of the raft its mast and sails is clearly distinguished on the surface of the water this wondrous sea is after all infinite in its extent it must be quite as wide as the mediterraneanor perhaps even as the great atlantic ocean why after all should it not be so my uncle has on more than one occasion tried deepsea soundings he tied the cross of one of our heaviest crowbars to the extremity of a cord which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms we had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead when the crowbar was finally dragged on board hans called my attention to some singular marks upon its surface the piece of iron looked as if it had been crushed between two very hard substances i looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance tander said he of course i was at a loss to understand i turned round towards my uncle absorbed in gloomy reflections i had little wish to disturb him from his reverie i accordingly turned once more towards our worthy icelander hans very quietly and significantly opened his mouth once or twice as if in the act of biting and in this way made me understand his meaning teeth cried i with stupefaction as i examined the bar of iron with more attention yes there can be no doubt about the matter the indentations on the bar of iron are the marks of teeth what jaws must the owner of such molars be possessed of have we then come upon a monster of unknown species which still exists within the vast waste of watersa monster more voracious than a shark more terrible and bulky than the whale i am unable to withdraw my eyes from the bar of iron actually half crushed is then my dream about to come truea dread and terrible reality all day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations and my imagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of reflection until after a sleep of many hours this day as on other sundays we observed as a day of rest and pious meditation monday august 17th i have been trying to realize from memory the particular instincts of those antediluvian animals of the secondary period which succeeding to the mollusca to the crustacea and to the fish preceded the appearance of the race of mammifers the generation of reptiles then reigned supreme upon the earth these hideous monsters ruled everything in the seas of the secondary period which formed the strata of which the jura mountains are composed nature had endowed them with perfect organization what a gigantic structure was theirs what vast and prodigious strength they possessed the existing saurians which include all such reptiles as lizards crocodiles and alligators even the largest and most formidable of their class are but feeble imitations of their mighty sires the animals of ages long ago if there were giants in the days of old there were also gigantic animals i shuddered as i evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these awful monsters no eye of man had seen them in the flesh they took their walks abroad upon the face of the earth thousands of ages before man came into existence and their fossil bones discovered in the limestone have allowed us to reconstruct them anatomically and thus to get some faint idea of their colossal formation i recollect once seeing in the great museum of hamburg the skeleton of one of these wonderful saurians it measured no less than thirty feet from the nose to the tail am i then an inhabitant of the earth of the present day destined to find myself face to face with a representative of this antediluvian family i can scarcely believe it possible i can hardly believe it true and yet these marks of powerful teeth upon the bar of iron can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the bite of a crocodile my eyes stare wildly and with terror upon the subterranean sea every moment i expect one of these monsters to rise from its vast cavernous depths i fancy that the worthy professor in some measure shares my notions if not my fears for after an attentive examination of the crowbar he cast his eyes rapidly over the mighty and mysterious ocean what could possess him to leave the land i thought as if the depth of this water was of any importance to us no doubt he has disturbed some terrible monster in his watery home and perhaps we may pay dearly for our temerity anxious to be prepared for the worst i examined our weapons and saw that they were in a fit state for use my uncle looked on at me and nodded his head approvingly he too has noticed what we have to fear already the uplifting of the waters on the surface indicates that something is in motion below the danger approaches it comes nearer and nearer it behooves us to be on the watch tuesday august 18th evening came at last the hour when the desire for sleep caused our eyelids to be heavy night there is not properly speaking in this place any more than there is in summer in the arctic regions hans however is immovable at the rudder when he snatches a moment of rest i really cannot say i take advantage of his vigilance to take some little repose but two hours after i was awakened from a heavy sleep by an awful shock the raft appeared to have struck upon a sunken rock it was lifted right out of the water by some wondrous and mysterious power and then started off twenty fathoms distant eh what is it cried my uncle starting up are we shipwrecked or what hans raised his hand and pointed to where about two hundred yards off a large black mass was moving up and down i looked with awe my worst fears were realized it is a colossal monster i cried clasping my hands yes cried the agitated professor and there yonder is a huge sea lizard of terrible size and shape and farther on behold a prodigious crocodile look at his hideous jaws and that row of monstrous teeth ha he has gone a whale a whale shouted the professor i can see her enormous fins see see how she blows air and water two liquid columns rose to a vast height above the level of the sea into which they fell with a terrific crash waking up the echoes of that awful place we stood stillsurprised stupefied terrorstricken at the sight of this group of fearful marine monsters more hideous in the reality than in my dream they were of supernatural dimensions the very smallest of the whole party could with ease have crushed our raft and ourselves with a single bite hans seizing the rudder which had flown out of his hand puts it hard aweather in order to escape from such dangerous vicinity but no sooner does he do so than he finds he is flying from scylla to charybdis to leeward is a turtle about forty feet wide and a serpent quite as long with an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters look which way we will it is impossible for us to fly the fearful reptiles advanced upon us they turned and twisted about the raft with awful rapidity they formed around our devoted vessel a series of concentric circles i took up my rifle in desperation but what effect can a rifle ball produce upon the armor scales with which the bodies of these horrid monsters are covered we remain still and dumb from utter horror they advance upon us nearer and nearer our fate appears certain fearful and terrible on one side the mighty crocodile on the other the great sea serpent the rest of the fearful crowd of marine prodigies have plunged beneath the briny waves and disappeared i am about to fire at any risk and try the effect of a shot hans the guide however interfered by a sign to check me the two hideous and ravenous monsters passed within fifty fathoms of the raft and then made a rush at one anothertheir fury and rage preventing them from seeing us the combat commenced we distinctly made out every action of the two hideous monsters but to my excited imagination the other animals appeared about to take part in the fierce and deadly strugglethe monster the whale the lizard and the turtle i distinctly saw them every moment i pointed them out to the icelander but he only shook his head tva he said whattwo only does he say surely he is mistaken i cried in a tone of wonder he is quite right replied my uncle coolly and philosophically examining the terrible duel with his telescope and speaking as if he were in a lecture room how can that be yes it is so the first of these hideous monsters has the snout of a porpoise the head of a lizard the teeth of a crocodile and it is this that has deceived us it is the most fearful of all antediluvian reptiles the worldrenowned ichthyosaurus or great fish lizard and the other the other is a monstrous serpent concealed under the hard vaulted shell of the turtle the terrible enemy of its fearful rival the plesiosaurus or sea crocodile hans was quite right the two monsters only disturbed the surface of the sea at last have mortal eyes gazed upon two reptiles of the great primitive ocean i see the flaming red eyes of the ichthyosaurus each as big or bigger than a mans head nature in its infinite wisdom had gifted this wondrous marine animal with an optical apparatus of extreme power capable of resisting the pressure of the heavy layers of water which rolled over him in the depths of the ocean where he usually fed it has by some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race for it is as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas this one measures not less than a hundred feet in length and i can form some idea of his girth when i see him lift his prodigious tail out of the waters his jaw is of awful size and strength and according to the bestinformed naturalists it does not contain less than a hundred and eightytwo teeth the other was the mighty plesiosaurus a serpent with a cylindrical trunk with a short stumpy tail with fins like a bank of oars in a roman galley its whole body covered by a carapace or shell and its neck as flexible as that of a swan rose more than thirty feet above the waves a tower of animated flesh these animals attacked one another with inconceivable fury such a combat was never seen before by mortal eyes and to us who did see it it appeared more like the phantasmagoric creation of a dream than anything else they raised mountains of water which dashed in spray over the raft already tossed to and fro by the waves twenty times we seemed on the point of being upset and hurled headlong into the waves hideous hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty cavernhisses which carried terror to our hearts the awful combatants held each other in a tight embrace i could not make out one from the other still the combat could not last forever and woe unto us whichsoever became the victor one hour two hours three hours passed away without any decisive result the struggle continued with the same deadly tenacity but without apparent result the deadly opponents now approached now drew away from the raft once or twice we fancied they were about to leave us altogether but instead of that they came nearer and nearer we crouched on the raft ready to fire at them at a moments notice poor as the prospect of hurting or terrifying them was still we were determined not to perish without a struggle suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappeared beneath the waves leaving behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea we were nearly drawn down by the indraft of the water several minutes elapsed before anything was again seen was this wonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean was the last act of this terrible drama to take place without spectators it was impossible for us to say suddenly at no great distance from us an enormous mass rises out of the watersthe head of the great plesiosaurus the terrible monster is now wounded unto death i can see nothing now of his enormous body all that could be distinguished was his serpentlike neck which he twisted and curled in all the agonies of death now he struck the waters with it as if it had been a gigantic whip and then again wriggled like a worm cut in two the water was spurted up to a great distance in all directions a great portion of it swept over our raft and nearly blinded us but soon the end of the beast approached nearer and nearer his movements slackened visibly his contortions almost ceased and at last the body of the mighty snake lay an inert dead mass on the surface of the now calm and placid waters as for the ichthyosaurus has he gone down to his mighty cavern under the sea to rest or will he reappear to destroy us this question remained unanswered and we had breathing time chapter 31 the sea monster wednesday august 19th fortunately the wind which for the present blows with some violence has allowed us to escape from the scene of the unparalleled and extraordinary struggle hans with his usual imperturbable calm remained at the helm my uncle who for a short time had been withdrawn from his absorbing reveries by the novel incidents of this sea fight fell back again apparently into a brown study his eyes were fixed impatiently on the widespread ocean our voyage now became monotonous and uniform dull as it has become i have no desire to have it broken by any repetition of the perils and adventures of yesterday thursday august 20th the wind is now n n e and blows very irregularly it has changed to fitful gusts the temperature is exceedingly high we are now progressing at the average rate of about ten miles and a half per hour about twelve oclock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears i make a note of the fact without even venturing a suggestion as to its cause it was one continued roar as of a sea falling over mighty rocks far off in the distance said the professor dogmatically there is some rock or some island against which the sea lashed to fury by the wind is breaking violently hans without saying a word clambered to the top of the mast but could make out nothing the ocean was level in every direction as far as the eye could reach three hours passed away without any sign to indicate what might be before us the sound began to assume that of a mighty cataract i expressed my opinion on this point strongly to my uncle he merely shook his head i however am strongly impressed by a conviction that i am not wrong are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall cast us into the abyss probably this mode of descending into the abyss may be agreeable to the professor because it would be something like the vertical descent he is so eager to make i entertain a very different opinion whatever be the truth it is certain that not many leagues distant there must be some very extraordinary phenomenon for as we advance the roar becomes something mighty and stupendous is it in the water or in the air i cast hasty glances aloft at the suspended vapors and i seek to penetrate their mighty depths but the vault above is tranquil the clouds which are now elevated to the very summit appear utterly still and motionless and completely lost in the irradiation of electric light it is necessary therefore to seek for the cause of this phenomenon elsewhere i examine the horizon now perfectly calm pure and free from all haze its aspect still remains unchanged but if this awful noise proceeds from a cataractif so to speak in plain english this vast interior ocean is precipitated into a lower basinif these tremendous roars are produced by the noise of falling waters the current would increase in activity and its increasing swiftness would give me some idea of the extent of the peril with which we are menaced i consult the current it simply does not exist there is no such thing an empty bottle cast into the water lies to leeward without motion about four oclock hans rises clambers up the mast and reaches the truck itself from this elevated position his looks are cast around they take in a vast circumference of the ocean at last his eyes remain fixed his face expresses no astonishment but his eyes slightly dilate he has seen something at last cried my uncle i think so i replied hans came down stood beside us and pointed with his right hand to the south der nere he said there replied my uncle and seizing his telescope he looked at it with great attention for about a minute which to me appeared an age i knew not what to think or expect yes yes he cried in a tone of considerable surprise there it is what i asked a tremendous spurt of water rising out of the waves some other marine monster i cried already alarmed perhaps then let us steer more to the westward for we know what we have to expect from antediluvian animals was my eager reply go ahead said my uncle i turned towards hans hans was at the tiller steering with his usual imperturbable calm nevertheless if from the distance which separated us from this creature a distance which must be estimated at not less than a dozen leagues one could see the column of water spurting from the blowhole of the great animal his dimensions must be something preternatural to fly is therefore the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence but we have not come into that part of the world to be prudent such is my uncles determination we accordingly continued to advance the nearer we come the loftier is the spouting water what monster can fill himself with such huge volumes of water and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty jets at eight oclock in the evening reckoning as above ground where there is day and night we are not more than two leagues from the mighty beast its long black enormous mountainous body lies on the top of the water like an island but then sailors have been said to have gone ashore on sleeping whales mistaking them for land is it illusion or is it fear its length cannot be less than a thousand fathoms what then is this cetaceous monster of which no cuvier ever thought it is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep the sea seems unable to lift him upwards it is rather the waves which break on his huge and gigantic frame the waterspout rising to a height of five hundred feet breaks in spray with a dull sullen roar we advance like senseless lunatics towards this mighty mass i honestly confess that i was abjectly afraid i declared that i would go no farther i threatened in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail i attacked the professor with considerable acrimony calling him foolhardy mad i know not what he made no answer suddenly the imperturbable hans once more pointed his finger to the menacing object iholmei an island cried my uncle an island i replied shrugging my shoulders at this poor attempt at deception of course it is cried my uncle bursting into a loud and joyous laugh but the waterspout geyser said hans yes of coursea geyser replied my uncle still laughing a geyser like those common in iceland jets like this are the great wonders of the country at first i would not allow that i had been so grossly deceived what could be more ridiculous than to have taken an island for a marine monster but kick as one may one must yield to evidence and i was finally convinced of my error it was nothing after all but a natural phenomenon as we approached nearer and nearer the dimensions of the liquid sheaf of waters became truly grand and stupendous the island had at a distance presented the appearance of an enormous whale whose head rose high above the waters the geyser a word the icelanders pronounce geysir and which signifies fury rose majestically from its summit dull detonations are heard every now and then and the enormous jet taken as it were with sudden fury shakes its plume of vapor and bounds into the first layer of the clouds it is alone neither spurts of vapor nor hot springs surround it and the whole volcanic power of that region is concentrated in one sublime column the rays of electric light mix with this dazzling sheaf every drop as it falls assuming the prismatic colors of the rainbow let us go on shore said the professor after some minutes of silence it is necessary however to take great precaution in order to avoid the weight of falling waters which would cause the raft to founder in an instant hans however steers admirably and brings us to the other extremity of the island i was the first to leap on the rock my uncle followed while the eiderduck hunter remained still like a man above any childish sources of astonishment we were now walking on granite mixed with siliceous sandstone the soil shivered under our feet like the sides of boilers in which overheated steam is forcibly confined it is burning we soon came in sight of the little central basin from which rose the geyser i plunged a thermometer into the water which ran bubbling from the centre and it marked a heat of a hundred and sixtythree degrees this water therefore came from some place where the heat was intense this was singularly in contradiction with the theories of professor hardwigg i could not help telling him my opinion on the subject well said he sharply and what does this prove against my doctrine nothing replied i dryly seeing that i was running my head against a foregone conclusion nevertheless i am compelled to confess that until now we have been most remarkably fortunate and that this voyage is being accomplished in most favorable conditions of temperature but it appears evident in fact certain that we shall sooner or later arrive at one of those regions where the central heat will reach its utmost limits and will go far beyond all the possible gradations of thermometers visions of the hades of the ancients believed to be in the centre of the earth floated through my imagination we shall however see what we shall see that is the professors favorite phrase now having christened the volcanic island by the name of his nephew the leader of the expedition turned away and gave the signal for embarkation i stood still however for some minutes gazing upon the magnificent geyser i soon was able to perceive that the upward tendency of the water was irregular now it diminished in intensity and then suddenly it regained new vigor which i attributed to the variation of the pressure of the accumulated vapors in its reservoir at last we took our departure going carefully round the projecting and rather dangerous rocks of the southern side hans had taken advantage of this brief halt to repair the raft before we took our final departure from the island however i made some observations to calculate the distance we had gone over and i put them down in my journal since we left port gretchen we had traveled two hundred and seventy leaguesmore than eight hundred mileson this great inland sea we were therefore six hundred and twenty leagues from iceland and exactly under england chapter 32 the battle of the elements friday august 21st this morning the magnificent geyser had wholly disappeared the wind had freshened up and we were fast leaving the neighborhood of henrys island even the roaring sound of the mighty column was lost to the ear the weather if under the circumstances we may use such an expression is about to change very suddenly the atmosphere is being gradually loaded with vapors which carry with them the electricity formed by the constant evaporation of the saline waters the clouds are slowly but sensibly falling towards the sea and are assuming a darkolive texture the electric rays can scarcely pierce through the opaque curtain which has fallen like a drop scene before this wondrous theater on the stage of which another and terrible drama is soon to be enacted this time it is no fight of animals it is the fearful battle of the elements i feel that i am very peculiarly influenced as all creatures are on land when a deluge is about to take place the cumuli a perfectly oval kind of cloud piled upon the south presented a most awful and sinister appearance with the pitiless aspect often seen before a storm the air is extremely heavy the sea is comparatively calm in the distance the clouds have assumed the appearance of enormous balls of cotton or rather pods piled one above the other in picturesque confusion by degrees they appear to swell out break and gain in number what they lose in grandeur their heaviness is so great that they are unable to lift themselves from the horizon but under the influence of the upper currents of air they are gradually broken up become much darker and then present the appearance of one single layer of a formidable character now and then a lighter cloud still lit up from above rebounds upon this grey carpet and is lost in the opaque mass there can be no doubt that the entire atmosphere is saturated with electric fluid i am myself wholly impregnated my hairs literally stand on end as if under the influence of a galvanic battery if one of my companions ventured to touch me i think he would receive rather a violent and unpleasant shock about ten oclock in the morning the symptoms of the storm became more thorough and decisive the wind appeared to soften down as if to take breath for a renewed attack the vast funereal pall above us looked like a huge baglike the cave of aeolus in which the storm was collecting its forces for the attack i tried all i could not to believe in the menacing signs of the sky and yet i could not avoid saying as it were involuntarily i believe we are going to have bad weather the professor made me no answer he was in a horrible in a detestable humorto see the ocean stretching interminably before his eyes on hearing my words he simply shrugged his shoulders we shall have a tremendous storm i said again pointing to the horizon these clouds are falling lower and lower upon the sea as if to crush it a great silence prevailed the wind wholly ceased nature assumed a dead calm and ceased to breathe upon the mast where i noticed a sort of slight ignis fatuus the sail hangs in loose heavy folds the raft is motionless in the midst of a dark heavy seawithout undulation without motion it is as still as glass but as we are making no progress what is the use of keeping up the sail which may be the cause of our perdition if the tempest should suddenly strike us without warning let us lower the sail i said it is only an act of common prudence nono cried my uncle in an exasperated tone a hundred times no let the wind strike us and do its worst let the storm sweep us away where it willonly let me see the glimmer of some coastof some rocky cliffs even if they dash our raft into a thousand pieces no keep up the sailno matter what happens these words were scarcely uttered when the southern horizon underwent a sudden and violent change the long accumulated vapors were resolved into water and the air required to fill up the void produced became a wild and raging tempest it came from the most distant corners of the mighty cavern it raged from every point of the compass it roared it yelled it shrieked with glee as of demons let loose the darkness increased and became indeed darkness visible the raft rose and fell with the storm and bounded over the waves my uncle was cast headlong upon the deck i with great difficulty dragged myself towards him he was holding on with might and main to the end of a cable and appeared to gaze with pleasure and delight at the spectacle of the unchained elements hans never moved a muscle his long hair driven hither and thither by the tempest and scattered wildly over his motionless face gave him a most extraordinary appearancefor every single hair was illuminated by little sparkling sprigs his countenance presents the extraordinary appearance of an antediluvian man a true contemporary of the megatherium still the mast holds good against the storm the sail spreads out and fills like a soap bubble about to burst the raft rushes on at a pace impossible to estimate but still less swiftly than the body of water displaced beneath it the rapidity of which may be seen by the lines which fly right and left in the wake the sail the sail i cried making a trumpet of my hands and then endeavoring to lower it let it alone said my uncle more exasperated than ever ineji said hans gently shaking his head nevertheless the rain formed a roaring cataract before this horizon of which we were in search and to which we were rushing like madmen but before this wilderness of waters reached us the mighty veil of cloud was torn in twain the sea began to foam wildly and the electricity produced by some vast and extraordinary chemical action in the upper layer of cloud is brought into play to the fearful claps of thunder are added dazzling flashes of lightning such as i had never seen the flashes crossed one another hurled from every side while the thunder came pealing like an echo the mass of vapor becomes incandescent the hailstones which strike the metal of our boots and our weapons are actually luminous the waves as they rise appear to be fireeating monsters beneath which seethes an intense fire their crests surmounted by combs of flame my eyes are dazzled blinded by the intensity of light my ears are deafened by the awful roar of the elements i am compelled to hold onto the mast which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm to which none ever before seen by mariners bore any resemblance here my traveling notes become very incomplete loose and vague i have only been able to make out one or two fugitive observations jotted down in a mere mechanical way but even their brevity even their obscurity show the emotions which overcame me sunday august 23rd where have we got to in what region are we wandering we are still carried forward with inconceivable rapidity the night has been fearful something not to be described the storm shows no signs of cessation we exist in the midst of an uproar which has no name the detonations as of artillery are incessant our ears literally bleed we are unable to exchange a word or hear each other speak the lightning never ceases to flash for a single instant i can see the zigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of mighty vaults if it were to give way and fall upon us other lightnings plunge their forked streaks in every direction and take the form of globes of fire which explode like bombshells over a beleaguered city the general crash and roar do not apparently increase it has already gone far beyond what human ear can appreciate if all the powder magazines in the world were to explode together it would be impossible for us to hear worse noise there is a constant emission of light from the storm clouds the electric matter is incessantly released evidently the gaseous principles of the air are out of order innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam whither are we going my uncle still lies at full length upon the raft without speakingwithout taking any note of time the heat increases i look at the thermometer to my surprise it indicatesithe exact figure is here rubbed out in my manuscripti monday august 24th this terrible storm will never end why should not this state of the atmosphere so dense and murky once modified again remain definitive we are utterly broken and harassed by fatigue hans remains just as usual the raft runs to the southeast invariably we have now already run two hundred leagues from the newly discovered island about twelve oclock the storm became worse than ever we are obliged now to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft or everything would be swept away we make ourselves fast too each man lashing the other the waves drive over us so that several times we are actually under water we had been under the painful necessity of abstaining from speech for three days and three nights we opened our mouths we moved our lips but no sound came even when we placed our mouths to each others ears it was the same the wind carried the voice away my uncle once contrived to get his head close to mine after several almost vain endeavors he appeared to my nearly exhausted senses to articulate some word i had a notion more from intuition than anything else that he said to me we are lost i took out my notebook from which under the most desperate circumstances i never parted and wrote a few words as legibly as i could take in sail with a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced his head had scarcely time to fall back in the position from which he had momentarily raised it than a disk or ball of fire appeared on the very edge of the raftour devoted our doomed craft the mast and sail are carried away bodily and i see them swept away to a prodigious height like a kite we were frozen actually shivered with terror the ball of fire half white half azurecolored about the size of a teninch bombshell moved along turning with prodigious rapidity to leeward of the storm it ran about here there and everywhere it clambered up one of the bulwarks of the raft it leaped upon the sack of provisions and then finally descended lightly fell like a football and landed on our powder barrel horrible situation an explosion of course was now inevitable by heavens mercy it was not so the dazzling disk moved on one side it approached hans who looked at it with singular fixity then it approached my uncle who cast himself on his knees to avoid it it came towards me as i stood pale and shuddering in the dazzling light and heat it pirouetted round my feet which i endeavored to withdraw an odor of nitrous gas filled the whole air it penetrated to the throat to the lungs i felt ready to choke why is it that i cannot withdraw my feet are they riveted to the flooring of the raft no the fall of the electric globe has turned all the iron on board into loadstonesthe instruments the tools the arms are clanging together with awful and horrible noise the nails of my heavy boots adhere closely to the plate of iron incrustated in the wood i cannot withdraw my foot it is the old story again of the mountain of adamant at last by a violent and almost superhuman effort i tear it away just as the ball which is still executing its gyratory motions is about to run round it and drag me with itif oh what intense stupendous light the globe of fire burstswe are enveloped in cascades of living fire which flood the space around with luminous matter then all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep i had just time to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring of the raft hans at the helm spitting fire under the influence of the electricity which seemed to have gone through him whither are we going i ask and echo answers whither tuesday august 25th i have just come out of a long fainting fit the awful and hideous storm still continues the lightning has increased in vividness and pours out its fiery wrath like a brood of serpents let loose in the atmosphere are we still upon the sea yes and being carried along with incredible velocity we have passed under england under the channel under france probably under the whole extent of europe another awful clamor in the distance this time it is certain that the sea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance then chapter 33 our route reversed here ends what i call my journal of our voyage on board the raft which journal was happily saved from the wreck i proceed with my narrative as i did before i commenced my daily notes what happened when the terrible shock took place when the raft was cast upon the rocky shore it would be impossible for me now to say i felt myself precipitated violently into the boiling waves and if i escaped from a certain and cruel death it was wholly owing to the determination of the faithful hans who clutching me by the arm saved me from the yawning abyss the courageous icelander then carried me in his powerful arms far out of the reach of the waves and laid me down upon a burning expanse of sand where i found myself some time afterwards in the company of my uncle the professor then he quietly returned towards the fatal rocks against which the furious waves were beating in order to save any stray waifs from the wreck this man was always practical and thoughtful i could not utter a word i was quite overcome with emotion my whole body was broken and bruised with fatigue it took hours before i was anything like myself meanwhile there fell a fearful deluge of rain drenching us to the skin its very violence however proclaimed the approaching end of the storm some overhanging rocks afforded us a slight protection from the torrents under this shelter hans prepared some food which however i was unable to touch and exhausted by the three weary days and nights of watching we fell into a deep and painful sleep my dreams were fearful but at last exhausted nature asserted her supremacy and i slumbered next day when i awoke the change was magical the weather was magnificent air and sea as if by mutual consent had regained their serenity every trace of the storm even the faintest had disappeared i was saluted on my awakening by the first joyous tones i had heard from the professor for many a day his gaiety indeed was something terrible well my lad he cried rubbing his hands together have you slept soundly might it not have been supposed that we were in the old house on the konigstrasse that i had just come down quietly to my breakfast and that my marriage with gretchen was to take place that very day my uncles coolness was exasperating alas considering how the tempest had driven us in an easterly direction we had passed under the whole of germany under the city of hamburg where i had been so happy under the very street which contained all i loved and cared for in the world it was a positive fact that i was only separated from her by a distance of forty leagues but these forty leagues were of hard impenetrable granite all these dreary and miserable reflections passed through my mind before i attempted to answer my uncles question why what is the matter he cried cannot you say whether you have slept well or not i have slept very well was my reply but every bone in my body aches i suppose that will lead to nothing nothing at all my boy it is only the result of the fatigue of the last few daysthat is all you appearif i may be allowed to say soto be very jolly this morning i said delighted my dear boy delighted was never happier in my life we have at last reached the wishedfor port the end of our expedition cried i in a tone of considerable surprise no but to the confines of that sea which i began to fear would never end but go round the whole world we will now tranquilly resume our journey by land and once again endeavor to dive into the centre of the earth my dear uncle i began in a hesitating kind of way allow me to ask you one question certainly harry a dozen if you think proper one will suffice how about getting back i asked how about getting back what a question to ask we have not as yet reached the end of our journey i know that all i want to know is how you propose we shall manage the return voyage in the most simple manner in the world said the imperturbable professor once we reach the exact centre of this sphere either we shall find a new road by which to ascend to the surface or we shall simply turn round and go back by the way we came i have every reason to believe that while we are traveling forward it will not close behind us then one of the first matters to see to will be to repair the raft was my rather melancholy response of course we must attend to that above all things continued the professor then comes the allimportant question of provisions i urged have we anything like enough left to enable us to accomplish such great such amazing designs as you contemplate carrying out i have seen into the matter and my answer is in the affirmative hans is a very clever fellow and i have reason to believe that he has saved the greater part of the cargo but the best way to satisfy your scruples is to come and judge for yourself saying which he led the way out of the kind of open grotto in which we had taken shelter i had almost begun to hope that which i should rather have feared and this was the impossibility of such a shipwreck leaving even the slightest signs of what it had carried as freight i was however thoroughly mistaken as soon as i reached the shores of this inland sea i found hans standing gravely in the midst of a large number of things laid out in complete order my uncle wrung his hands with deep and silent gratitude his heart was too full for speech this man whose superhuman devotion to his employers i not only never saw surpassed nor even equaled had been hard at work all the time we slept and at the risk of his life had succeeded in saving the most precious articles of our cargo of course under the circumstances we necessarily experienced several severe losses our weapons had wholly vanished but experience had taught us to do without them the provision of powder had however remained intact after having narrowly escaped blowing us all to atoms in the storm well said the professor who was now ready to make the best of everything as we have no guns all we have to do is to give up all idea of hunting yes my dear sir we can do without them but what about all our instruments here is the manometer the most useful of all and which i gladly accept in lieu of the rest with it alone i can calculate the depth as we proceed by its means alone i shall be able to decide when we have reached the centre of the earth ha ha but for this little instrument we might make a mistake and run the risk of coming out at the antipodes all this was said amid bursts of unnatural laughter but the compass i cried without that what can we do here it is safe and sound he cried with real joy ah ah and here we have the chronometer and the thermometers hans the hunter is indeed an invaluable man it was impossible to deny this fact as far as the nautical and other instruments were concerned nothing was wanting then on further examination i found ladders cords pickaxes crowbars and shovels all scattered about on the shore there was however finally the most important question of all and that was provisions but what are we to do for food i asked let us see to the commissariat department replied my uncle gravely the boxes which contained our supply of food for the voyage were placed in a row along the strand and were in a capital state of preservation the sea had in every case respected their contents and to sum up in one sentence taking into consideration biscuits salt meat schiedam and dried fish we could still calculate on having about four months supply if used with prudence and caution four months cried the sanguine professor in high glee then we shall have plenty of time both to go and to come and with what remains i undertake to give a grand dinner to my colleagues of the johanneum i sighed i should by this time have become used to the temperament of my uncle and yet this man astonished me more and more every day he was the greatest human enigma i ever had known now he before we do anything else we must lay in a stock of fresh water the rain has fallen in abundance and filled the hollows of the granite there is a rich supply of water and we have no fear of suffering from thirst which in our circumstances is of the last importance as for the raft i shall recommend hans to repair it to the best of his abilities though i have every reason to believe we shall not require it again how is that i cried more amazed than ever at my uncles style of reasoning i have an idea my dear boy it is none other than this simple fact we shall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered i began to look at my uncle with vague suspicion an idea had more than once taken possession of me and this was that he was going mad and yet little did i think how true and prophetic his words were doomed to be and now he said having seen to all these matters of detail to breakfast i followed him to a sort of projecting cape after he had given his last instructions to our guide in this original position with dried meat biscuit and a delicious cup of tea we made a satisfactory meali may say one of the most welcome and pleasant i ever remember exhaustion the keen atmosphere the state of calm after so much agitation all contributed to give me an excellent appetite indeed it contributed very much to producing a pleasant and cheerful state of mind while breakfast was in hand and between the sips of warm tea i asked my uncle if he had any idea of how we now stood in relation to the world above for my part i added i think it will be rather difficult to determine well if we were compelled to fix the exact spot said my uncle it might be difficult since during the three days of that awful tempest i could keep no account either of the quickness of our pace or of the direction in which the raft was going still we will endeavor to approximate to the truth we shall not i believe be so very far out well if i recollect rightly i replied our last observation was made at the geyser island harrys island my boy harrys island do not decline the honor of having named it given your name to an island discovered by us the first human beings who trod it since the creation of the world let it be so then at harrys island we had already gone over two hundred and seventy leagues of sea and we were i believe about six hundred leagues more or less from iceland good i am glad to see that you remember so well let us start from that point and let us count four days of storm during which our rate of traveling must have been very great i should say that our velocity must have been about eighty leagues to the twentyfour hours i agreed that i thought this a fair calculation there were then three hundred leagues to be added to the grand total yes and the central sea must extend at least six hundred leagues from side to side do you know my boy harry that we have discovered an inland lake larger than the mediterranean certainly and we only know of its extent in one way it may be hundreds of miles in length very likely then said i after calculating for some for some minutes if your previsions are right we are at this moment exactly under the mediterranean itself do you think so yes i am almost certain of it are we not nine hundred leagues distant from reykjavik that is perfectly true and a famous bit of road we have traveled my boy but why we should be under the mediterranean more than under turkey or the atlantic ocean can only be known when we are sure of not having deviated from our course and of this we know nothing i do not think we were driven very far from our course the wind appears to me to have been always about the same my opinion is that this shore must be situated to the southeast of port gretchen goodi hope so it will however be easy to decide the matter by taking the bearings from our departure by means of the compass come along and we will consult that invaluable invention the professor now walked eagerly in the direction of the rock where the indefatigable hans had placed the instruments in safety my uncle was gay and lighthearted he rubbed his hands and assumed all sorts of attitudes he was to all appearance once more a young man since i had known him never had he been so amiable and pleasant i followed him rather curious to know whether i had made any mistake in my estimation of our position as soon as we had reached the rock my uncle took the compass placed it horizontally before him and looked keenly at the needle as he had at first shaken it to give it vivacity it oscillated considerably and then slowly assumed its right position under the influence of the magnetic power the professor bent his eyes curiously over the wondrous instrument a violent start immediately showed the extent of his emotion he closed his eyes rubbed them and took another and a keener survey then he turned slowly round to me stupefaction depicted on his countenance what is the matter said i beginning to be alarmed he could not speak he was too overwhelmed for words he simply pointed to the instrument i examined it eagerly according to his mute directions and a loud cry of surprise escaped my lips the needle of the compass pointed due northin the direction we expected was the south it pointed to the shore instead of to the high seas i shook the compass i examined it with a curious and anxious eye it was in a state of perfection no blemish in any way explained the phenomenon whatever position we forced the needle into it returned invariably to the same unexpected point it was useless attempting to conceal from ourselves the fatal truth there could be no doubt about it unwelcome as was the fact that during the tempest there had been a sudden slant of wind of which we had been unable to take any account and thus the raft had carried us back to the shores we had left apparently forever so many days before chapter 34 a voyage of discovery it would be altogether impossible for me to give any idea of the utter astonishment which overcame the professor on making this extraordinary discovery amazement incredulity and rage were blended in such a way as to alarm me during the whole course of my life i had never seen a man at first so chapfallen and then so furiously indignant the terrible fatigues of our sea voyage the fearful dangers we had passed through had all all gone for nothing we had to begin them all over again instead of progressing as we fondly expected during a voyage of so many days we had retreated every hour of our expedition on the raft had been so much lost time presently however the indomitable energy of my uncle overcame every other consideration so he said between his set teeth fatality will play me these terrible tricks the elements themselves conspire to overwhelm me with mortification air fire and water combine their united efforts to oppose my passage well they shall see what the earnest will of a determined man can do i will not yield i will not retreat even one inch and we shall see who shall triumph in this great contestman or nature standing upright on a rock irritated and menacing professor hardwigg like the ferocious ajax seemed to defy the fates i however took upon myself to interfere and to impose some sort of check upon such insensate enthusiasm listen to me uncle i said in a firm but temperate tone of voice there must be some limit to ambition here below it is utterly useless to struggle against the impossible pray listen to reason we are utterly unprepared for a sea voyage it is simply madness to think of performing a journey of five hundred leagues upon a wretched pile of beams with a counterpane for a sail a paltry stick for a mast and a tempest to contend with as we are totally incapable of steering our frail craft we shall become the mere plaything of the storm and it is acting the part of madmen if we a second time run any risk upon this dangerous and treacherous central sea these are only a few of the reasons and arguments i put togetherreasons and arguments which to me appeared unanswerable i was allowed to go on without interruption for about ten minutes the explanation to this i soon discovered the professor was not even listening and did not hear a word of all my eloquence to the raft he cried in a hoarse voice when i paused for a reply such was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will i tried again i begged and implored him i got into a passion but i had to deal with a will more determined than my own i seemed to feel like the waves which fought and battled against the huge mass of granite at our feet which had smiled grimly for so many ages at their puny efforts hans meanwhile without taking part in our discussion had been repairing the raft one would have supposed that he instinctively guessed at the further projects of my uncle by means of some fragments of cordage he had again made the raft seaworthy while i had been speaking he had hoisted a new mast and sail the latter already fluttering and waving in the breeze the worthy professor spoke a few words to our imperturbable guide who immediately began to put our baggage on board and to prepare for our departure the atmosphere was now tolerably clear and pure and the northeast wind blew steadily and serenely it appeared likely to last for some time what then could i do could i undertake to resist the iron will of two men it was simply impossible if even i could have hoped for the support of hans this however was out of the question it appeared to me that the icelander had set aside all personal will and identity he was a picture of abnegation i could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his master all i could do therefore was to swim with the stream in a mood of stolid and sullen resignation i was about to take my accustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my shoulder there is no hurry my boy he said we shall not start until tomorrow i looked the picture of resignation to the dire will of fate under the circumstances he said i ought to neglect no precautions as fate has cast me upon these shores i shall not leave without having completely examined them in order to understand this remark i must explain that though we had been driven back to the northern shore we had landed at a very different spot from that which had been our starting point port gretchen must we calculated be very much to the westward nothing therefore was more natural and reasonable than that we should reconnoiter this new shore upon which we had so unexpectedly landed let us go on a journey of discovery i cried and leaving hans to his important operation we started on our expedition the distance between the foreshore at high water and the foot of the rocks was considerable it would take about half an hours walking to get from one to the other as we trudged along our feet crushed innumerable shells of every shape and sizeonce the dwelling place of animals of every period of creation i particularly noticed some enormous shellscarapaces turtle and tortoise species the diameter of which exceeded fifteen feet they had in past ages belonged to those gigantic glyptodons of the pliocene period of which the modern turtle is but a minute specimen in addition the whole soil was covered by a vast quantity of stony relics having the appearance of flints worn by the action of the waves and lying in successive layers one above the other i came to the conclusion that in past ages the sea must have covered the whole district upon the scattered rocks now lying far beyond its reach the mighty waves of ages had left evident marks of their passage on reflection this appeared to me partially to explain the existence of this remarkable ocean forty leagues below the surface of the earths crust according to my new and perhaps fanciful theory this liquid mass must be gradually lost in the deep bowels of the earth i had also no doubt that this mysterious sea was fed by infiltration of the ocean above through imperceptible fissures nevertheless it was impossible not to admit that these fissures must now be nearly choked up for if not the cavern or rather the immense and stupendous reservoir would have been completely filled in a short space of time perhaps even this water having to contend against the accumulated subterraneous fires of the interior of the earth had become partially vaporized hence the explanation of those heavy clouds suspended over our heads and the superabundant display of that electricity which occasioned such terrible storms in this deep and cavernous sea this lucid explanation of the phenomena we had witnessed appeared to me quite satisfactory however great and mighty the marvels of nature may seem to us they are always to be explained by physical reasons everything is subordinate to some great law of nature it now appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sedimentary soil formed like all the soils of that period so frequent on the surface of the globe by the subsidence of the waters the professor who was now in his element carefully examined every rocky fissure let him only find an opening and it directly became important to him to examine its depth for a whole mile we followed the windings of the central sea when suddenly an important change took place in the aspect of the soil it seemed to have been rudely cast up convulsionized as it were by a violent upheaving of the lower strata in many places hollows here and hillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the terrestrial mass we advanced with great difficulty over the broken masses of granite mixed with flint quartz and alluvial deposits when a large field more even than a field a plain of bones appeared suddenly before our eyes it looked like an immense cemetery where generation after generation had mingled their mortal dust lofty barrows of early remains rose at intervals they undulated away to the limits of the distant horizon and were lost in a thick and brown fog on that spot some three square miles in extent was accumulated the whole history of animal lifescarcely one creature upon the comparatively modern soil of the upper and inhabited world had not there existed nevertheless we were drawn forward by an allabsorbing and impatient curiosity our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains of those prehistoric fossils for which the museums of great cities quarrel even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels a thousand such naturalists as cuvier would not have sufficed to recompose the skeletons of the organic beings which lay in this magnificent osseous collection i was utterly confounded my uncle stood for some minutes with his arms raised on high towards the thick granite vault which served us for a sky his mouth was wide open his eyes sparkled wildly behind his spectacles which he had fortunately saved his head bobbed up and down and from side to side while his whole attitude and mien expressed unbounded astonishment he stood in the presence of an endless wondrous and inexhaustibly rich collection of antediluvian monsters piled up for his own private and peculiar satisfaction fancy an enthusiastic lover of books carried suddenly into the very midst of the famous library of alexandria burned by the sacrilegious omar and which some miracle had restored to its pristine splendor such was something of the state of mind in which uncle hardwigg was now placed for some time he stood thus literally aghast at the magnitude of his discovery but it was even a greater excitement when darting wildly over this mass of organic dust he caught up a naked skull and addressed me in a quivering voice harry my boyharrythis is a human head a human head uncle i said no less amazed and stupefied than himself yes nephew ah mr milneedwardsah mr de quatrefageswhy are you not here where i ami professor hardwigg chapter 35 discovery upon discovery in order fully to understand the exclamation made by my uncle and his allusions to these illustrious and learned men it will be necessary to enter into certain explanations in regard to a circumstance of the highest importance to paleontology or the science of fossil life which had taken place a short time before our departure from the upper regions of the earth on the 28th of march 1863 some navigators under the direction of m boucher de perthes were at work in the great quarries of moulinquignon near abbeville in the department of the somme in france while at work they unexpectedly came upon a human jawbone buried fourteen feet below the surface of the soil it was the first fossil of the kind that had ever been brought to the light of day near this unexpected human relic were found stone hatchets and carved flints colored and clothed by time in one uniform brilliant tint of verdigris the report of this extraordinary and unexpected discovery spread not only all over france but over england and germany many learned men belonging to various scientific bodies and noteworthy among others messrs milneedwards and de quatrefages took the affair very much to heart demonstrated the incontestable authenticity of the bone in question and becameto use the phrase then recognized in englandthe most ardent supporters of the jawbone question to the eminent geologists of the united kingdom who looked upon the fact as certainmessrs falconer buck carpenter and otherswere soon united the learned men of germany and among those in the first rank the most eager the most enthusiastic was my worthy uncle professor hardwigg the authenticity of a human fossil of the quaternary period seemed then to be incontestably demonstrated and even to be admitted by the most skeptical this system or theory call it what you will had it is true a bitter adversary in m elie de beaumont this learned man who holds such a high place in the scientific world holds that the soil of moulinquignon does not belong to the diluvium but to a much less ancient stratum and in accordance with cuvier in this respect he would by no means admit that the human species was contemporary with the animals of the quaternary epoch my worthy uncle professor hardwigg in concert with the great majority of geologists had held firm had disputed discussed and finally after considerable talking and writing m elie de beaumont had been pretty well left alone in his opinions we were familiar with all the details of this discussion but were far from being aware then that since our departure the matter had entered upon a new phase other similar jawbones though belonging to individuals of varied types and very different natures had been found in the movable grey sands of certain grottoes in france switzerland and belgium together with arms utensils tools bones of children of men in the prime of life and of old men the existence of men in the quaternary period became therefore more positive every day but this was far from being all new remains dug up from the pliocene or tertiary deposits had enabled the more farseeing or audacious among learned men to assign even a far greater degree of antiquity to the human race these remains it is true were not those of men that is were not the bones of men but objects decidedly having served the human race shinbones thighbones of fossil animals regularly scooped out and in fact sculpturedbearing the unmistakable signs of human handiwork by means of these wondrous and unexpected discoveries man ascended endless centuries in the scale of time he in fact preceded the mastodon became the contemporary of the ielephas meridionalisithe southern elephant acquired an antiquity of over a hundred thousand years since that is the date given by the most eminent geologists to the pliocene period of the earth such was then the state of paleontologic science and what we moreover knew sufficed to explain our attitude before this great cemetery of the plains of the hardwigg ocean it will now be easy to understand the professors mingled astonishment and joy when on advancing about twenty yards he found himself in the presence of i may say face to face with a specimen of the human race actually belonging to the quaternary period it was indeed a human skull perfectly recognizable had a soil of very peculiar nature like that of the cemetery of st michel at bordeaux preserved it during countless ages this was the question i asked myself but which i was wholly unable to answer but this head with stretched and parchmenty skin with the teeth whole the hair abundant was before our eyes as in life i stood mute almost paralyzed with wonder and awe before this dread apparition of another age my uncle who on almost every occasion was a great talker remained for a time completely dumfounded he was too full of emotion for speech to be possible after a while however we raised up the body to which the skull belonged we stood it on end it seemed to our excited imaginations to look at us with its terrible hollow eyes after some minutes of silence the man was vanquished by the professor human instincts succumbed to scientific pride and exultation professor hardwigg carried away by his enthusiasm forgot all the circumstances of our journey the extraordinary position in which we were placed the immense cavern which stretched far away over our heads there can be no doubt that he thought himself at the institution addressing his attentive pupils for he put on his most doctorial style waved his hand and began gentlemen i have the honor on this auspicious occasion to present to you a man of the quaternary period of our globe many learned men have denied his very existence while other able persons perhaps of even higher authority have affirmed their belief in the reality of his life if the st thomases of paleontology were present they would reverentially touch him with their fingers and believe in his existence thus acknowledging their obstinate heresy i know that science should be careful in relation to all discoveries of this nature i am not without having heard of the many barnums and other quacks who have made a trade of suchlike pretended discoveries i have of course heard of the discovery of the kneebones of ajax of the pretended finding of the body of orestes by the spartiates and of the body of asterius ten spans long fifteen feetof which we read in pausanias i have read everything in relation to the skeleton of trapani discovered in the fourteenth century and which many persons chose to regard as that of polyphemus and the history of the giant dug up during the sixteenth century in the environs of palmyra you are well aware as i am gentlemen of the existence of the celebrated analysis made near lucerne in 1577 of the great bones which the celebrated doctor felix plater declared belonged to a giant about nineteen feet high i have devoured all the treatises of cassanion and all those memoirs pamphlets speeches and replies published in reference to the skeleton of teutobochus king of the cimbri the invader of gaul dug out of a gravel pit in dauphine in 1613 in the eighteenth century i should have denied with peter campet the existence of the preadamites of scheuchzer i have had in my hands the writing called gigans here my uncle was afflicted by the natural infirmity which prevented him from pronouncing difficult words in public it was not exactly stuttering but a strange sort of constitutional hesitation the writing named gigans he repeated he however could get no further giganteo impossible the unfortunate word would not come out there would have been great laughter at the institution had the mistake happened there gigantosteology at last exclaimed professor hardwigg between two savage growls having got over our difficulty and getting more and more excited yes gentlemen i am well acquainted with all these matters and know also that cuvier and blumenbach fully recognized in these bones the undeniable remains of mammoths of the quaternary period but after what we now see to allow a doubt is to insult scientific inquiry there is the body you can see it you can touch it it is not a skeleton it is a complete and uninjured body preserved with an anthropological object i did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion if i could but wash this corpse in a solution of sulphuric acid continued my uncle i would undertake to remove all the earthy particles and these resplendent shells which are incrusted all over this body but i am without this precious dissolving medium nevertheless such as it is this body will tell its own history here the professor held up the fossil body and exhibited it with rare dexterity no professional showman could have shown more activity as on examination you will see my uncle continued it is only about six feet in length which is a long way from the pretended giants of early days as to the particular race to which it belonged it is incontestably caucasian it is of the white race that is of our own the skull of this fossil being is a perfect ovoid without any remarkable or prominent development of the cheekbones and without any projection of the jaw it presents no indication of the prognathism which modifies the facial angle4 measure the angle for yourselves and you will find that it is just ninety degrees but i will advance still farther on the road of inquiry and deduction and i dare venture to say that this human sample or specimen belongs to the japhetic family which spread over the world from india to the uttermost limits of western europe there is no occasion gentlemen to smile at my remarks 4 the facial angle is formed by two planesone more or less vertical which is in a straight line with the forehead and the incisors the other horizontal which passes through the organs of hearing and the lower nasal bone prognathism in anthropological language means that particular projection of the jaw which modifies the facial angle of course nobody smiled but the excellent professor was so accustomed to beaming countenances at his lectures that he believed he saw all his audience laughing during the delivery of his learned dissertation yes he continued with renewed animation this is a fossil man a contemporary of the mastodons with the bones of which this whole amphitheater is covered but if i am called on to explain how he came to this place how these various strata by which he is covered have fallen into this vast cavity i can undertake to give you no explanation doubtless if we carry ourselves back to the quaternary epoch we shall find that great and mighty convulsions took place in the crust of the earth the continually cooling operation through which the earth had to pass produced fissures landslips and chasms through which a large portion of the earth made its way i come to no absolute conclusion but there is the man surrounded by the works of his hands his hatchets and his carved flints which belong to the stony period and the only rational supposition is that like myself he visited the centre of the earth as a traveling tourist a pioneer of science at all events there can be no doubt of his great age and of his being one of the oldest race of human beings the professor with these words ceased his oration and i burst forth into loud and unanimous applause besides after all my uncle was right much more learned men than his nephew would have found it rather hard to refute his facts and arguments another circumstance soon presented itself this fossilized body was not the only one in this vast plain of bonesthe cemetery of an extinct world other bodies were found as we trod the dusty plain and my uncle was able to choose the most marvelous of these specimens in order to convince the most incredulous in truth it was a surprising spectacle the successive remains of generations and generations of men and animals confounded together in one vast cemetery but a great question now presented itself to our notice and one we were actually afraid to contemplate in all its bearings had these once animated beings been buried so far beneath the soil by some tremendous convulsion of nature after they had been earth to earth and ashes to ashes or had they lived here below in this subterranean world under this factitious sky borne married and given in marriage and died at last just like ordinary inhabitants of the earth up to the present moment marine monsters fish and suchlike animals had alone been seen alive the question which rendered us rather uneasy was a pertinent one were any of these men of the abyss wandering about the deserted shores of this wondrous sea of the centre of the earth this was a question which rendered me very uneasy and uncomfortable how should they really be in existence would they receive us men from above chapter 36 what is it for a long and weary hour we tramped over this great bed of bones we advanced regardless of everything drawn on by ardent curiosity what other marvels did this great cavern containwhat other wondrous treasures for the scientific man my eyes were quite prepared for any number of surprises my imagination lived in expectation of something new and wonderful the borders of the great central ocean had for some time disappeared behind the hills that were scattered over the ground occupied by the plain of bones the imprudent and enthusiastic professor who did not care whether he lost himself or not hurried me forward we advanced silently bathed in waves of electric fluid by reason of a phenomenon which i cannot explain and thanks to its extreme diffusion now complete the light illumined equally the sides of every hill and rock its seat appeared to be nowhere in no determined force and produced no shade whatever the appearance presented was that of a tropical country at midday in summerin the midst of the equatorial regions and under the vertical rays of the sun all signs of vapor had disappeared the rocks the distant mountains some confused masses of faroff forests assumed a weird and mysterious aspect under this equal distribution of the luminous fluid we resembled to a certain extent the mysterious personage in one of hoffmanns fantastic talesthe man who lost his shadow after we had walked about a mile farther we came to the edge of a vast forest not however one of the vast mushroom forests we had discovered near port gretchen it was the glorious and wild vegetation of the tertiary period in all its superb magnificence huge palms of a species now unknown superb palmacitesa genus of fossil palms from the coal formationpines yews cypress and conifers or conebearing trees the whole bound together by an inextricable and complicated mass of creeping plants a beautiful carpet of mosses and ferns grew beneath the trees pleasant brooks murmured beneath umbrageous boughs little worthy of this name for no shade did they give upon their borders grew small treelike shrubs such as are seen in the hot countries on our own inhabited globe the one thing wanting in these plants these shrubs these treeswas color forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun they were vapid and colorless all shade was lost in one uniform tint of a brown and faded character the leaves were wholly devoid of verdure and the flowers so numerous during the tertiary period which gave them birth were without color and without perfume something like paper discolored by long exposure to the atmosphere my uncle ventured beneath the gigantic groves i followed him though not without a certain amount of apprehension since nature had shown herself capable of producing such stupendous vegetable supplies why might we not meet with mammals just as large and therefore dangerous i particularly remarked in the clearings left by trees that had fallen and been partially consumed by time many leguminous beanlike shrubs such as the maple and other eatable trees dear to ruminating animals then there appeared confounded together and intermixed the trees of such varied lands specimens of the vegetation of every part of the globe there was the oak near the palm tree the australian eucalyptus an interesting class of the order myrtaceaeleaning against the tall norwegian pine the poplar of the north mixing its branches with those of the new zealand kauris it was enough to drive the most ingenious classifier of the upper regions out of his mind and to upset all his received ideas about botany suddenly i stopped short and restrained my uncle the extreme diffuseness of the light enabled me to see the smallest objects in the distant copses i thought i sawno i really did see with my own eyesimmense gigantic animals moving about under the mighty trees yes they were truly gigantic animals a whole herd of mastodons not fossils but living and exactly like those discovered in 1801 on the marshy banks of the great ohio in north america yes i could see these enormous elephants whose trunks were tearing down large boughs and working in and out the trees like a legion of serpents i could hear the sounds of the mighty tusks uprooting huge trees the boughs crackled and the whole masses of leaves and green branches went down the capacious throats of these terrible monsters that wondrous dream when i saw the antehistorical times revivified when the tertiary and quaternary periods passed before me was now realized and there we were alone far down in the bowels of the earth at the mercy of its ferocious inhabitants my uncle paused full of wonder and astonishment come he said at last when his first surprise was over come along my boy and let us see them nearer no replied i restraining his efforts to drag me forward we are wholly without arms what should we do in the midst of that flock of gigantic quadrupeds come away uncle i implore you no human creature can with impunity brave the ferocious anger of these monsters no human creature said my uncle suddenly lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper you are mistaken my dear henry look look yonder it seems to me that i behold a human beinga being like ourselvesa man i looked shrugging my shoulders decided to push incredulity to its very last limits but whatever might have been my wish i was compelled to yield to the weight of ocular demonstration yesnot more than a quarter of a mile off leaning against the trunk of an enormous tree was a human beinga proteus of these subterranean regions a new son of neptune keeping this innumerable herd of mastodons immanis pecoris custos immanior ipse5 5 the keeper of gigantic cattle himself still more gigantic yesit was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the ground in the great cemetery but a giant capable of guiding and driving these prodigious monsters his height was above twelve feet his head as big as the head of a buffalo was lost in a mane of matted hair it was indeed a huge mane like those which belonged to the elephants of the earlier ages of the world in his hand was a branch of a tree which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd we remained profoundly still speechless with surprise but we might at any moment be seen by him nothing remained for us but instant flight come come i cried dragging my uncle along and for the first time he made no resistance to my wishes a quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster now that i think of the matter calmly and that i reflect upon it dispassionately now that months years have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell uswhat am i to think what am i to believe no it is utterly impossible our ears must have deceived us and our eyes have cheated us we have not seen what we believed we had seen no human being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean world no generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe without taking note of those who peopled the surface without communication with them it was folly folly folly nothing else i am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in structure the human raceof some monkey of the first geological epochs like that discovered by m lartet in the ossiferous deposit of sansan but this animal or being whichsoever it was surpassed in height all things known to modern science never mind however unlikely it may be it might have been a monkeybut a man a living man and with him a whole generation of gigantic animals buried in the entrails of the earthit was too monstrous to be believed chapter 37 the mysterious dagger during this time we had left the bright and transparent forest far behind us we were mute with astonishment overcome by a kind of feeling which was next door to apathy we kept running in spite of ourselves it was a perfect right which resembled one of those horrible sensations we sometimes meet with in our dreams instinctively we made our way towards the central sea and i cannot now tell what wild thoughts passed through my mind nor of what follies i might have been guilty but for a very serious preoccupation which brought me back to practical life though i was aware that we were treading on a soil quite new to us i however every now and then noticed certain aggregations of rock the shape of which forcibly reminded me of those near port gretchen this confirmed moreover the indications of the compass and our extraordinary and unlookedfor as well as involuntary return to the north of this great central sea it was so like our starting point that i could scarcely doubt the reality of our position streams and cascades fell in hundreds over the numerous projections of the rocks i actually thought i could see our faithful and monotonous hans and the wonderful grotto in which i had come back to life after my tremendous fall then as we advanced still farther the position of the cliffs the appearance of a stream the unexpected profile of a rock threw me again into a state of bewildering doubt after some time i explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle he confessed to a similar feeling of hesitation he was totally unable to make up his mind in the midst of this extraordinary but uniform panorama there can be no doubt i insisted that we have not landed exactly at the place whence we first took our departure but the tempest has brought us above our starting point i think therefore that if we follow the coast we shall once more find port gretchen in that case cried my uncle it is useless to continue our exploration the very best thing we can do is to make our way back to the raft are you quite sure harry that you are not mistaken it is difficult was my reply to come to any decision for all these rocks are exactly alike there is no marked difference between them at the same time the impression on my mind is that i recognize the promontory at the foot of which our worthy hans constructed the raft we are i am nearly convinced near the little port if this be not it i added carefully examining a creek which appeared singularly familiar to my mind my dear harryif this were the case we should find traces of our own footsteps some signs of our passage and i can really see nothing to indicate our having passed this way but i see something i cried in an impetuous tone of voice as i rushed forward and eagerly picked up something which shone in the sand under my feet what is it cried the astonished and bewildered professor this was my reply and i handed to my startled relative a rusty dagger of singular shape what made you bring with you so useless a weapon he exclaimed it was needlessly hampering yourself i bring it it is quite new to me i never saw it beforeare you sure it is not out of your collection not that i know of said the professor puzzled i have no recollection of the circumstance it was never my property this is very extraordinary i said musing over the novel and singular incident not at all there is a very simple explanation harry the icelanders are known to keep up the use of these antiquated weapons and this must have belonged to hans who has let it fall without knowing it i shook my head that dagger had never been in the possession of the pacific and taciturn hans i knew him and his habits too well then what can it beunless it be the weapon of some antediluvian warrior i continued of some living man a contemporary of that mighty shepherd from whom we have just escaped but nomystery upon mysterythis is no weapon of the stony epoch nor even of the bronze period it is made of excellent steel ere i could finish my sentence my uncle stopped me short from entering upon a whole train of theories and spoke in his most cold and decided tone of voice calm yourself my dear
